1.0.E {Of the Holy Scripture.}
1.0.M {Papaume Manittooe Wussukwhonganash.}

1.11.E ALthough the Light of Nature, and the Works of Creation and Providence, do so far manifest the Goodness, Wisdom and Power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and of his Will, which is necessary unto Salvation:
1.11.M MAnittoe Waantamooonk, & wunneetuonk wahteauwahuwae wahteauwaheoneau nashpe kezteaue & naumoe nanawontamooe anakausuongash God; kah yeug nanawompatogeek yeush anakausuongash nashpe wuttinnepomantamooongane Wequai nukkonoog matta toh ennomaseinate.

1.12.E Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in diverse manners to reveal himself, and declare that his Will unto his Church; and afterwards for the better preserving and propagating of the Truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly to writing: which maketh the holy Scripture to be most necessary; those former wayes of Gods revealing his will unto his People being now ceased.
1.12.M Qut yeush Manittoe Anakausuongash mat tapenumoomunooash enninnumauonate ne wahteauonk papaume God, kah papaume wuttenantamooonk God ne tapenumoomoouk wutche micheme wadchanittuonk.

1.21.E Under the name of holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the Books of the Old and New Testament, which are these:

1.26.E All of which are given by the inspiration of God to be the Rule of Faith and life.
1.26.M Wame uttiyeush kittinninnummonteananonash nashpe wunnashanittassuonk God wutche Wunnamptamooe, kah pomantamooe Quttuhwheganit.

1.31.E The Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of Divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of, then other humane writings.
1.31.M Yeush Booksash nish hettamunash Apocrypha, matta ummoomunoash wutche Manittoe wunnashanittassuonk, kah matta chipiyeumooash Manittoe wussukwhonganash; kah yowutche matta ummenuhkesuonganooash ut Ummoeuwehkomunganit God, kah matta papaquanne tapeneamoomunooash, asuh auwahteauoounash qut webe tatuppeyeue onkatoganash woṣketompae wussukwhonganash.

1.41.E The Authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the Testimony of any man or Church, but wholly upon God (who is Truth it self) the Author thereof, and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.
1.41.M Ummenuhkesuonk wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash newaj woh wunnamptamunash, kah noswehtamunash matta oomoo wutche woṣketompae asuh Moeuwehkomungane oowauwaonganit, qut webe wutche God nehenwonche wuhhogkuh (noh wunnamuhkuteyeuut) noh Ayik wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash, kah yowutche woh attumunumunash, newutche Wuttinnoowaongash God.

1.51.E We may be moved and induced by the Testimony of the Church, to an high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture. And the heavenliness of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the majesty of the Style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes of the only way of mans Salvation, the the many other incomparable excellencies, and the intire perfection thereof, are Arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; Yet notwithstanding, our full perswasion and assurance of the infallible Truth and Divine Authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.
1.51.M Nashpe Ummoeuwehkomungane wauwaongane woh kootwantamhetteamun womoausue mishantimunate wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash Kesukquiyeue kah Menuhkesue kuhkootamwehteaongash wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash, sohsumooe wunnoowaonk wame chippiyeuash, Ennomat mamusse Manittooe wussukwhonganash (ne aninumauonate wame sohsumooonk en Godut) oowahteauwahuaonk nutahtomun nashpe wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash papautne ne webe may en woṣketompae wadchanittuonganit, kah monatash onkatoganash anue wunnegen sohsumooongash, wame yeush teanteaguahnish pahkeyeue pohquttumoogash wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonk ne Wuttinnoowaonk God. Qut nutahtomun pahkontamwe nupweshassoowaonk, kah anooshonk papaume Manittoe kah menuhkesue wunnamuhkutteyeuuk wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash webe nashpe ennometahae anakausuonk wunnetupanatamwe Nashauanit, ne wauwomoouk nashpe Wuttinnoowaonk ut nuttahhunonash.

1.61.E The whole Counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own Glory, Mans Salvation, Faith and Life, is either expresly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelations of the Spirit, or Traditions of men. 
1.61.E Mamusse kogkkohqutteamooonk God papaume wame teanteaguasinish quenauhuagish wutche nehenwonche sohsumoonk, woṣketompae wadchanittuonk, wunnamptamooonk, kah Pomantamonk asuh pahkeyeue wussukhumun ut Manittooe wussukwhonganash, asuh woh mukkinnumun nashpe wunnegenue kah menuhkesue papodtantamooongash wutche wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash, uttiyeush monteag nishnoh ut ahquompi matta woh kootnehteauooun, asuh nashpe wuṣku nashauanittue oowoshwununumooonganash, asuh nashpe woṣketompae kuhkootomwehteaongash. 

1.62.E Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word:
1.62.M Qut nussampooamun ennometahae nashauanittue wequaiyeuonk quenauhuagk wutche wadchanittue oowohwohtamooonganit wame yeush teanteaguassinish nish God woshwunnumup ut wuttinnoowaonganit. 

1.63.E And that there are some circumstances concerning the Worship of God and Government of the Church, common to humane actions and Societies, which are to be ordered by the Light of Nature, and Christian Prudence, according to the general Rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.
1.63.E Kah nawhutche na asqueneunkquokish papaume wowussumauonk God kah nanawontamumte Ummoeuwehkomunk wunnoowomoougish woṣketompae usseongash nish woh nanawunnamun nashpe wuttinne pomantamoe Wequai, kah Christiane wahteanteaonk, neaunak nanwe quttuhwheganash Wuttinnoowaonk, nish nagwutteae nanawontamagish.

1.71.E All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all: 
1.71.E Wame teanteagquassinish ut Manittoe wussukwhonganash mat tatuppeyeue nukkummattinnoo wahteauun ut nehenwoncheyeuoogish, asuh tatuppeyeue pahkiyeuoo wame woṣketompaog;

1.72.E yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other,
1.72.M Qut wame yeush teanteagquassinish nish quenauhuagish wahteauun, asuh wunnamptammun, asuh nanawehteauun wutche wadchanittuonk pahkeyeue ponamunash kah woshwunumunash asuh wutch pasuk, asuh onkatog aiyeuonk ut wussukwhonganehtu: 

1.73.E that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.
1.73.M kah matta webe wahtonteaenuog, nanawontamoohettit, woh attumunumwog wamattooe wahteauonk papaume mamusse Manittooe wuttenantamooonk wutche wadchanittonk.

1.81.E The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native Language of the People of God of old) and the New-Testament in Greek (which at the time of writing of it was most generally known to the Nations) being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore Authentical; so as in all Controversies of Religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them.
1.81.M Nukkone Testament ne wussukhumun ut Hebrewe unnontoowaonk, kah Wuṣku Testament ne wussukhumun ut Greeke unnontoowaonk enninnummoadtinnash nashpe wunnashaunittassuonk God, kah pohkiyeue wadchanumunash wutch aiyuhhuhsukkaue pometuongash nashpe nehtaue wunnanawontamooonk God, kah yowutche anue wunnamuhkuteyeuooash, kah ut wame Manittowompae channoowaongash Moeuwehkomunk maumachish woh kodtantam oosummukqunate nashpe wunnetupanatamwe Wussukwhongash.  

1.82.E But because these Original Tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and search them;
1.83.M Qut onch newaj yeush nukkone Unnontoowaongash matta wahteauoounash nashpe wame ummissinninneumoh God, uttiyeug wussampoiyeumoocheeg ut wussukwhonganash God, kah anoonoog ut wabesuononate God yeush ogketamunate kah natinneakontamunate:

1.83.M therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar Language of every Nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.
1.83.M Yowutche qushkenumunash en unnontoowaonganit nishnoh wutohtimoin uttoh paomooukgish, onk woh Wuttinnoowaonk God moochekohteau ut wame, kah onk wame missinninnuog woh wahteauog tapeneamooe wowussumonate God, kah wutannoosuog nashpe wussukwhongane taphuwaonganit.

1.91.E The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, is the Scripture it self; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it must be searched and known by other places, that speak more clearly.
1.91.M Manittooe nehenwoncheyeue wussukwhonk ne sampoi Kuhkuhheeganoo ne nashpe nukquogquoshkinnumumun wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganash, kah yowuche natootomwehteaonk weogquttumuk uttoh anawuttamoouk, woh nattinneakontamun wutche onkatoganash aiyeuwongash nish anue pohkiyeue noowomooukgish.

1.10.E The Supream Judge by which all controversies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councils, Opinions of Ancient Writers, Doctrines of men and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whose Sentence we are to rest can be no other, but the holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit; into which Scripture so delivered, our Faith is finally resolved.
1.10.M Manittooe Wussukwhonk ne qunnunkquiyeue Wussittumwaenuoo ne nashpe wame Manittoowompae channoowaongash woh wussittumunash, kah wame kuhkoowaongash Konoonuttutcheeg, wuttenantamooonganooash nukkone wussukwhosuaenuog, woṣketompae kuhkootomwehteaongash, kah keme Nashauanittooog woh qutcheheoog nashpe yeu sampoi wussukwhongane quttuhwheeganit, ne kuttinninnummonteanane nashpe Nashauanit God, kah yeuut Noonamptamooonganun maumachish tapontamoomoo,

2.11.E THere is but one onely living and true God; who is infinite in Being and Perfection, a most pure Spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passion, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute, working all things according to the Counsel of his own immutable and most righteous Will, for his own Glory, most loving, gracious, mercifull, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and withall, most just and terrible in his Judgements, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.

2.21.E God hath all Life, Glory, Goodness, Blessedness, in, and of himself; and is alone in, and unto himself, All sufficient, not standing in need of any Creatures which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto and upon them.

2.22.E He is the alone Fountain of all Being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and hath most Soveraign dominion over them, to do by them for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth: In his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible and independent upon the Creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain. He is most holy in all his Counsels, in all his Works, and in all his Commands.

2.31.E In the Unity of the God-head there be three Persons, of one Substance, Power, and Eternity, God the Father, God the Son and God the holy Ghost, The Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding, The son is eternally begotten of the Father; The holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. Which Doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our Communion with God, and comfortable dependence upon him.

3.51.E Those of mankind that are predestinated unto Life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his Will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting Glory, out of his meer free Grace and Love, without any foresight of Faith or good Works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the Creature, as Conditions or Causes moving him thereunto, and all to the praise of his glorious Grace.

3.81.E The Doctrine of this high Mystery of Predestination, is to be handled with special prudence and care, that men attending the will of God revealed in his Word, and yielding obedience thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual Vocation, be assured of their eternal Election.

4.23.E Besides this Law written in their hearts, they received a command not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of good and evil, which whiles they kept, they were happy in their communion with God, and had dominion over the Creatures.

5.0.M {Papaume Wunnanawontamooonganit God.}

5.11.E GOD the great Creator of all things, doth uphold, direct, dispose and govern all creatures, actions, and things from the greatest even to the least by his most wise and holy Providence, according to his infallible fore-knowledge, and the free and immutable counsel of his own Will, to the praise of the glory of his Wisdom, Power, Justice, Goodness & Mercy

5.21.E Although in relation to the fore-knowledge and decree of God, the first Cause, all things come to pass immutably, and infallibly; yet by the same Providence he ordereth them to fall out, according to the nature of second Causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently.
5.21.M Tohkonogque neaunak negonne oowahteauonk kah pogkodtantamooonk God, ne negonne Ennomai wame teanteaguassinish matohosue kah mat channantamwe enniyeuash, qut onch nashpe yeu nan nanawontamooonk God wanuhtunk yeush teanteaguassinish enniyeuash asuh quenauhikooe, asuh nanouwe, asuh nehenwoncheyeue, neaunake wuttinnepomantamooe nahohtoeu Ennomaiyeuash.

5.41.E The almighty Power, unsearchable Wisdom and the infinite Goodness of God, so far manifest themselves in his Providence, in that his determinate Counsel extendeth it self even to the first Fall, and all other sins of Angels and Men, (and that not by a bare permission) which also he most wisely and powerfully boundeth, and otherwise ordereth and governeth in a manifold Dispensation, to his own most holy ends,

5.51.E The most wise, righteous and gracious God doth oftentimes leave for a season his own children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to chastise them for their former sins, or to discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption, and deceitfulness of their hearts, that they may be humbled, and to raise them to a more close and constant dependence for their support upon himself, and to make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for sundry other just and holy ends.

5.61.E As for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God as a righteous Judge, for former sins, doth blind and harden, from them he not only withholdeth his grace, whereby they might have been enlightened in their understandings and wrought upon in their hearts;
5.61.M God nean sampweseae wussittumwaen pogkinnumwaheau, kah menuhketeahaheau matcheseae & peantamoe wosketompaog kah matta webe wutche nag kogkounum ummonanitteaonk, ne nashpe woh wequosumauoog ut oowohwohtamooonganoout; kah woh qushkeaheoog ut wuttahhooout,

5.62.E but sometimes also withdraweth the gifts which they had and exposeth them to such objects, as their corruption makes occasions of sin; and withal gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan, whereby it comes to pass that they harden themselves, even under those means which God useth for the softning of others.

6.11.E GOD having made a Covenant of Works and Life thereupon, with our first Parents, and all their posterity in them, they being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of Satan, did wilfully transgress the Law of their Creation, and break the Covenant in eating the forbidden fruit.

6.31.E They being the Root, and by Gods appointment standing in the room and stead of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed, and corrupted nature conveyed to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary generation.

6.61.E Every sin, both original and actual, being a transgression of the righteous Law of God, and contrary thereunto, doth in its own nature bring guilt upon the sinner, whereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and curse of the Law, and so made subject to death, with all miseries spiritual, temporal and eternal.

7.0.E {Of Gods Covenant with Man.}

7.11.E THE distance between God and the Creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures doe owe obedience to him as their Creator,

7.21.E The first Covenant made with man, was a Covenant of Works, wherein life was promised to {Adam}, and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience.

7.31.E Man by his fall having made himself uncapable of life by that Covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the Covenant of Grace;

7.32.E wherein he freely offereth unto Sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them Faith in him that they may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto life, his holy Spirit to make them willing and able to believe.
7.32.M uttiyeu tapeneam God quoshunumauonate pomantamooonk, kah wadchanittuonk nashpe Jesus Christ wame matcheseaenuog, anoonont wame wunnamptamunate ut Christ, onk woh wadchanoog, kah quoshomont enninnumauonat wame yeuh neeg kehtimomukeeg en micheme pomantamooonganit, wunnetupanatamwe Nashauanit wekontamwaheonate, kah tapenumwaheonate wunnamptamunate.

7.41.E This Covenant of Grace is frequently set forth in Scripture by the name of a Testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator, and to the everlasting Inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.

7.51.E Although this Covenant hath been differently and variously administred in respect of Ordinances and Institutions in the time of the Law, and since the coming of Christ in the flesh; yet for the substance and efficacy of it, to all its spiritual and saving ends, it is one and the same,

8.11.E IT pleased God in his eternal purpose, to chuse and ordain the Lord Jesus his onely begotten Son, according to a Covenant made between them both, to be the Mediator between God and Man; the Prophet, Priest, and King, the Head and Saviour of his Church, the Heir of all things, and Judge of the World: unto whom he did from all etertity give a People to be his feed, & to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified and glorified.

8.21.E The Son of God, the second Person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father, did, when the fulness of time was come, take upon him Mans nature with all the essential propertyes and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin, being conceived by the power of the holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin Mary, of her substance:

8.22.E So that two whole perfect and distinct natures, the Godhead and the Manhood, were inseperably joyned together in one Person, without conversion, composition, or confusion; which Person is very God and very Man, yet one Christ, the onely Mediator between God and Man.

8.31.E The Lord Jesus in his humane nature, thus united to the Divine in the Person of the Son; was sanctified and anointed with the holy Spirit above measure, having in him all the treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, in whom it pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell, to the end that being holy, harmless, undefiled and full of grace & truth, he might be throughly furnished to execute the Office of a Mediator and Surety;
8.31.M Lord Jesus ut oowoṣketompae wuttinne pomantamooonganit ogqueyeue pasukquinheau Manittooe wuttinne pomantamooonganit, wunnetupanatamwaheau, kah mat tabequthamooe sussequnau nashpe wunnetupanatamwe Nashauanit, kah tapeneam Wutooshin wame ne adtahshimeechimuk woh ayeumoash wuhhogkat waantamooonk wahteauonk, mat woskhuog, mat niṣkhuog, kah numwohteau monaneteaonk kah wunnamhkutteyeuonk, woh tapenum ussenate wunnohteahuaenue kah kenootamwanshitteaenue anakausuonk.

8.41.E This Office the Lord Jesus Christ did most willingly undertake; which that he might discharge, he was made under the Law, and did perfectly fulfil it, and underwent the punishment due to us, which we should have born and suffered, being made sin and a curse for us, enduring most grievous torments immediately from God in his Soul, & most painful sufferings in his body, was crucified, and died, was buried and remained under the power of death.

8.51.E The Lord Jesus by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of himself, which he through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, hath fully satisfied the Justice of God, and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the Kingdome of heaven, for all those whom the Father hath given unto him.

8.61.E Although the work of Redemption was not actually wrought by Christ till after his Incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy and benefits thereof were communicated to the Elect in all ages successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those Promises, Types and Sacrifices, wherein he was revealed and signified to be the Seed of the Woman, which should bruise the Serpents head, and the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world, being yesterday and to day the same, and for ever.

8.71.E Christ in the work of Mediation acteth according to both Natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to it self; yet by reason of the unity of the Person, that which is proper to one Nature, is sometimes in Scripture attributed to the Person denominated by the other Nature.

9.31.E Man by his Fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying Salvation, so as a natural man being altogether averse from that good and dead in sin, is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto.

9.42.E yet so, as that by reason of his remaining corruption, he doth not perfectly nor only will that which is good, but doth also will that which is evil.
9.42.M qut onch ne nashpe ennomai wutapehtunkooe aninnooonk mat panuppeyeue kah webe wekontam ne wanegik, qut onch wekontam ne machuk.

10.0.E {Of Effectual Calling.}
10.0.M {Papaume Menuhkesue wehkomaonk.}

10.11.E ALL those whom God hath predestinated unto life and those onely, he is pleased in his appointed & accepted time effectually to call by his Word and Spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they are by nature, to grace & salvation by Jesus Christ, inlightening their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of God, taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh, renewing their wills, and by his almighty power determining them to that which is good, and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ: yet so, as they come most freely, being made willing by his grace,
10.11.M WAme yeug God pogkodtantamup en pomantamunate, kah yeug webe tapeneam ut wunnehenwonche & wekontamwe ahquompi wehkomonate nashpe Wuttinnoowaonk kah wunnashauanittoomoh wutche wuttinnepomantamooongane nuppooe matcheseae wuttinniyeuonk en monaneteaonk kah wadchanittuonk nashpe Jesus Christ, wequaiyeukauont wuttinnantamooonganooout Nashauanittue kah wadchanittue wohwohtamunate Manittooe teanteaguassinish, amaunumauont ukqussukquanne wuttahhooout, kah enninnumauont weyausue metahhash, wusketeauont wekontamooonganoonout, kah nashpe wame menuhkesue missugkenuonk pogkodtantamauonate en ne wanegik, kah menuhkesue wutonchimont en Jesus Christ, qut ne ennih nanowe peyauog wekontamwaheoncheg nashpe ummonaneteaonk.

10.21.E This effectual Call is of Gods free and special grace alone, not from any thing at all foreseen in man, who is altogether passive therein, until being quickned and renewed by the holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this Call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it.
10.21.M Yeu menuhkosue Wehkomaonk webe nashpe nanowe kah nahnaneyeue Manittooe monaneteaonk, matta wutch nishnoh teag negonne naumuk ut woṣketompaut, newaj woṣketomp moawe wutonchimau no pajeh pomantamwaheau, kah wuskeheau nashpe wunnetupanatamwe Nashauanit yeu nashpe tapenumwaheau nampoohamunate yeu wehkomaonk, kah attumunumunate Manittooe monaneteaonk yeu ut wehkomaonganit quoshwunumauut, kah nookinumauut.

10.31.E Elect Infants dying in infancy, are regenerated and saved by Christ, who worketh when, and where and how he pleaseth:

10.41.E Others not elected, although they may be called by the Ministry of the Word, and may have some common operations of the Spirit, yet not being effectually drawn by the Father, they neither doe nor can come unto Christ, and therefore cannot be saved; much less can men not professing the Christian Religion, be saved in any other way whatsoever, be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature, and the law of that Religion they doe profess: And to assert and maintain that they may, is very pernicious, and to be detested.

11.0.E {Of Justification.}
11.0.M {Papaume sampwogquanittuonk.}

11.11.E THose whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth, not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, & by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ sake alone; nor by imputing Faith it self, the act of believing, or any other Evangelical Obedience to them, as their righteousness, but by imputing Christs active obedience unto the whole Law, and passive obedience in his sufferings and death, for their whole and sole righteousness, they receiving and resting on him and his righteousness by Faith; which Faith they have not of themselves, it is the gift of God.
11.11.M NAg God menuhkesue wehkomonche neh wussampweneheuh, matta nashpe numwohtoonk wuttinnomaiyeumooout sampweseonk, qut nashpe ahquoantamauaonk ummatcheseonganooooash kah nashpe ogquoantamauonate, kah attumunonate onatuh sampwesehettit kah yeu ennih mat wutch nishnoh teagq ut nag anakausimuk asuh nashpe nag usseemuk, qut webe wutche oowesuonk Christ, matta nashpe ohquoantamauonate en nag wunnamptamooonk nehenwonche, asuh wunnamptamooe usseonk, asuh nishnoh wonkatuk wunaunchemookae Noswehtamooonk, onatuh wussampweseonganoo; qut nashpe ogquoantamauonate usseae noswehtamooonk Christ en mamusse Naumatuonk, kah wutonkquomomoe noswehtamooonk, ut ootamehpunaongash, kah wunnuppooonganit wutche mamusse kah webe wussampweseonganoo; nag attumunoog kah anwohsinooonaog Christoh, kah wussampweseonk nashpe wunnamptamooonk, ne matta ahtauhetteeg wutche nehenwonche nagumau, ne ummagooonk God.

11.21.E Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ, and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of Justification; yet it is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces, and is no dead Faith, but worketh by Love.
11.21.M Wunnamptamooonk nashpe neyaneyeue attumunumooonk & anwohsinnooonaonk Christ, kah wussampweseonk, yeu webe sampweseae ompatamooeeganoooo, & wunnamptamooonk matta no[n]siyeumoo, qut wechaiyittoomoo wame ongatoganash wadchanittue monateaongash kah matta nuppooe wunnamptamooonganinnoo, anakausu nashpe womonittuonk.

11.31.E Christ by his Obedience and Death did fully discharge the debt of all those that are justified, and did by the sacrifice of himself, in the blood of his Cross, undergoing in their stead the penalty due unto them make a proper, real, and full satisfaction to Gods Justice in their behalf:
11.31.M Christ nashpe wunnoswehtamooonk kah wunnuppoowonk pakodche oadtehteaup unnontuhquawhuttuonk wame sampwesecheeg, kah nashpe wussephausuonk nehenwonche Nagum ut oosqheonk Uppummetunkapunneganit sasamatahwhaup neh nompe onkapunao[n]gash nish attumunumohetteupash kah neh nompe aiyimup musquantamooe wunnamuhkutee kah pakodche taphettuonk Manittooe sampweusseonganit

11.32.E Yet inasmuch as he was given by the Father for them, and his Obedience and Satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both freely, not for any thing in them, their Justification is only of free grace, that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the justification of Sinners.
11.32.M ut onch newutche enninnumauop nashpe Wutooshimau wutche nag, kah wunnoswehtamooonk kah wuttaphuaonk attumunumunash neh nompe, kah naneeswe nanowe, matta wutch nishnoh teag ut nahog, wussampwe, ogquanittuonganoo webe wutch nanowe monaneteaonk, wonk naneeswe piuhsuke sampwe ussseonk, kah wenauwetue monaneteaonk God woh sohsumwahtinnash ut wussampweseonganit matcheseaenuog.

11.41.E God did from all eternity decree to justifie all the Elect, and Christ did in the fulness of time dye for their sins, and rise again for their justification: 
11.41.M God wutche micheme kesantamup sampwoneheonate Pepenauitcheg, kah Christ ut numwohtae ahquompi nuppoop wutche ummatcheseonganoooash, kah wonk omokeep wutch wussampweseonganoo,

11.42.E Nevertheless, they are not justified personally, until the holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Christ unto them.
11.42.M Qut onch mat howanooooe sampweneheoog no pajeh wunnetupanatamwe Nashauanit ut wunne ahquompi usseae Christ anninnumauau.

11.51.E God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may by their sins fall under Gods fatherly displeasure:
11.51.M God nagwutteanum ahquoantamauonate ummatcheseonganash wame pepenauitcheg, kah tohkonogque matta woh penushaog wutche sampweseae wuttinniyeuonk, qut onch woh penushaog nashpe ummatcheseonganooash ut kenugke Manittooe wutooshimooe musquantamooonk,

11.52.E and in that condition they have not usually the light of his Countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.
11.52.M kah yeuut wuttinniyeuonk God matta yoyatcheh wunnompenumauoh wequaiyeue wuttinussuonk, no pajeh hohpaheahettit wuhhogkauh, & sampoahettit ummatcheseonganoooash, kah peantamohettit wutch ahquoantamoadtuonk kah wuṣkeheahettit wunnamptamooonganoo kah aiṣkoiantamooonganoo.

11.61.E The Justification of Believers under the old Testament, was in all these respects one and the same with the justification of Believers under the new Testament.
11.61.M Sampwogquanittuonk wunnamptamwaenuog ut kenugke nukkone Testament pasukqunnuoo, kah nenanyeuoo ut wame yeush natwontamooongash nashpe wussampweseonk wunnamptamwaenuog ut kenugke wuṣke Testament.

12.11.E ALL those that are justified, God vouchsaeth in and for his only Son Jesus Christ to make partakers of the grace of Adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the Libertyes and Priviledges of the Children of God, have his Name put upon them, receive the Spirit of Adoption, have access to the throne of Grace with boldness, are enabled to cry Abba Father, are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastned by him as by a Father, yet never cast off, but sealed to the day of Redemption, and inherit the Promises as Heirs of everlasting Salvation.

13.0.E {Of Sanctification.}
13.0.M {Papaume Wunnetupanatamooonk.}

13.11.E THey that are effectually called and regenerated, being united to Christ, having a new heart, and a new spirit created in them, through the virtue of Christs death and resurrection are also further sanctified really and personally through the same virtue, by his Word and Spirit dwelling in them, the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed, and the several lusts thereof are more and more weakned and mortified, and they more and more quickned, and strengthened in all saving graces, to the practice of all true holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.
13.11.M NAg menuhke wehkomoog kah nompe neetuog nashpe ummoosogqueonganoo Christut ahtauog wuske metah, & wuske nashauanit kezteauonaoh; nashpe menuhkesuonk wunnuppooonganit kah omohkeonganit Christ onkoue, wunnamuhkuttee, kah howanooooe wunneetupanatamheoog; kah nashpe ne nane ummenuhkesuonk nashpe Wuttinnoowaonk & Nashauanit Christ ne appehtunkhetticheh, sontimooonk mamusse matcheseae wuhhogkuh paguatauun, kah chadchaubeyeue matchekodtantamooongash yeu matcheseae wuhhogkuh, anue kah anue noochumwehteauunash & nehtauunash, kah anue moocheke quaquakqheoog, kah menuhkheoog ut wame wadchanittue monaneteaongash ussenate w[a]me wunnamuhkuttee wunnetupanatamwe usseongash nish netohut matta howan woh nauoh Lordoh.

13.21.E This Sanctification is throughout in the whole man, yet imperfect in this life, there abide stil some remnants of corruption in every part, whence ariseth a continual and irreconcileable war, the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.

13.31.E In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may much prevail, yet through the continual supply of strength from the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, the regenerate part doth overcome, and so the Saints grow in grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
13.31.M Yeuut mattompog tohkonogque nagwutteohteae aninnoowonk wutch ahquompi woh moocheke sohkauau, qut onch nashpe nagwutteae aninnummoadtuonganit wunnetupanatamwahuwae menuhkesuonk Wunnashauanit Christ, neetue chippe pish maumachish sohkauau, kah yeu wutch pish ennih wunnetupanatogeeg pish neetuog ut monaneteaonk, pannuppehettinate wunnetupanatamooonk ut wabesuongane qushaonganit God.

14.0.E {Of saving Faith.}
14.0.M {Papaume wadchanittue Wunnamptamooonk.}

14.11.E THE grace of Faith, whereby the Elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts, and is ordinarily wrought by the Ministry of the Word; by which also, and by the administration of the Seals, Prayer, and other means, it is increased and strengthened.
14.11.M WUnnamptamoe Monaneteaonk ne nashpe Pepenauitcheeg tapenumwaheoog wunnamptamunate en wadchanonate uketeahogkounoo ne wutanakausuonk Wunnashauanittoomoh Christ, kah nonnagwutteae anakauseumoo nashpe kuhkootomwehteae Wuttinnoowaonk; ne wonk nashpe, kah nashpe aninnumoadtuonk Menuhketeausue kuhkinneasuongash, Peantamooonk, kah onkatoganash aninnumoadtuongash moocheketeauun & menuhketeauun.

14.21.E By this Faith a Christian believeth to be true whatsoever is revealed in the word, for the Authority of God himself speaking therein, and acteth differently upon that which each particular passage thereof containeth, yielding obedience to the commands, trembling at the threatnings, and embracing the promises of God for this life, and that which is to come. 
14.21.M Yeu nashpe Wunnamptamooonk Christianuenin wunnamptam nishnoh teagq ne woshwunnumuk ut wuttinnoowaonganit, ne wunnamuhkutteyeuuk, webe wutche ummenuhkesuonk God nehenwonche yeuut keketoohkont, kah pepenooe usseen neaunak nishnoh wussukwhongane chadchaubeyeuuk ut wussukwhonganit, nooswehtauont annooteamooongash nunnukshont quogquohtoaongash, kah attumunont Manittoe quoshodtuongash wutch yeu pomantamooonk, & wutch pomantamooonk ne paomoouk. 

14.22.E But the principal acts of saving Faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of Grace.
14.22.M Qut negonneyeue usseongash wadchanittue Wunnamptamooonk nish attumunumunate, neemunumunate, & anwohsinnowontamunate webe Christ, wutch sampwogquanittuonk, wunneetupanatamooonk, kah micheme pomantamooonk nashpe ummenuhkesuonk monaneteae Wunnoowaonk.

14.31.E This Faith, although it be different in degrees, and may be weak or strong, yet it is in the least degree of it different in the kind or nature of it (as is all other saving grace) from the faith and common grace of temporary believers; 
14.31.M Yeu Wunnamptamooonk tohkonogque pepenooweyeuoo ut chippaiyeuut, kah woh noochumwi, kah menuhki, qut onch ut wuttinussin, kah wuttinnepomantamooonganit pepenooweyeuoo (neyane wame onkatoganash wadchanittue monaneteaogash) wutche wunnamptamooonk, kah nanwe monaneteaonk ahquompiyeue wunnamptamwaenuog; 

14.32.E and therefore, though it may be many times assailed and weakned, yet it gets the victory, growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through Christ, who is both the Author and Finisher of our Faith.
14.32.M kah yowutche tokonogque woh moochekit nompe aiyeuuhteaumoo, kah noochumweteaumoo, qut onch maumachish pish sohkuhseumoo, kah ut monaeushpekin en attumunumunate pahkontamwe annoosuonk nashpe Christ, noh waj kutchissik, kah noh adt pakodche kezteausik noonamptamooonganun.

15.0.E {Of Repentance unto Life and Salvation.}
15.0.M {Papaume Aiuṣkoiantamooonk en Pomantamooonganit kah Wadchanittuonganit.}

15.11.E SUch of the Elect as are converted at riper years, having sometime lived in the state of nature, and therein served divers lusts and pleasures, God in their effectual calling giveth them Repentance unto life.
15.11.M PEpenauitcheeg nag mat quinnuppenomukkuppaneeg ut ummukkiesunaout, qut tannuppomantamopaneeg ut wuttinne pomantamooongane wuttinniyeuonganit, kah yeuut wuttinninneumuhkussuog moocheke matchekodtantamoongash kah wekontamooongash, God ut ummenuhkesue wehkomuaonk wuttinnummauoh aiuskoiantamooonk en pomantamooonganit.

15.21.E Whereas there is none that doth good, and sinneth not, and the best of men may through the power and deceitfulness of their corruptions dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great sins and provocations;
15.21.M Tokonogque matta howan wunneseit, kah matta matcheseit, kah anue wanekitcheg nashpe asookekodteamooe menuhkesuonk wutanninooonganooout nish apehtunkquog, kah qutchuae menuhkesuonk woh penuhshaog en mishe matcheseongash, kah musquantamhuaongash, 

15.22.E God hath in the Covenant of Grace mercifully provided that Believers so sinning and falling, be renewed through repentance unto Salvation.
15.22.M qut onch God ut Monaneteae Wunnoowaonk kitteamonteanitteae quagwashwehtam, ne Wunnamptogeeg matchesehettit, kah penushahettit, woh wuṣkeheoog nashpe aiuskoiantamooonk en Wadchanittinnate.

15.31.E This saving Repentance is an Evangelical Grace, whereby a person being by the holy Ghost made sensible of the manifold evils of his sin, doth by Faith in Christ humble himself for it with godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrency, praying for pardon & strength of Grace, with a purpose and endeavour by supplyes of the Spirit, to walk before God unto all well pleasing in all things.
15.31.M Yeu wadchanittue Aiuṣkoiantamooonk wunnaunchemokae Monaneteaonganeuoo, ne nashpe wosketomp waamattamwaheau nashpe wunnetupantamwe Nashauanit papaume ummishe kah woskehuwae matcheseonk, kah hohpaheau wuhhogkuh nashpe Wunnamptamooonk ut Christut,nashpe Manittooe neuwantamooonk, & sekeneamooonk, kah nehchanumau wuhhogkuh, wutche peantamauont ahquoantamoadtuonk & monaneteae menuhkesuonk, kah kodtantam kah menehteanittam nashpe Nashauanittue aninnumoadtuonk pomushonate ut anaquabit God en wame wekontamunate ut wame teanteaguassinish.

15.41.E As Repentance is to be continued through the whole course of our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof;
15.41.M Neyane Aiuskoiantamooonk woh nagwutteayeuoo nashpe mamusse nuppomantamooonganunnonut waj ennomai wuhhogkat nuppooonk, kah qutchuaongash yeu wuhhogkat nuppooonk,

15.42.M neyane noswehtamooonganeuoo nishnoh woṣketomp nanasiyeue aiyuṣkoiantammunate wunnanasiyeue wahteaue matcheseongash.

15.51.E Such is the provision which God hath made through Christ in the Covenant of Grace, for the preservation of Believers unto salvation, that although there is no sin so small but it deserves damnation;
15.51.M Neonagk aninnumoadtuonk ne God quagwashwehtam nashpe Christ ut monaneteae wunnoowaonk, wutche pohquohwhunonate Wunnamptoggeeg en wadchanittuonk, ne tokonogque mat matcheseonk peasinninnoo, qut tumhouwomoo awakompanaonk, 

15.51.E yet there is no sin so great, that it shall bring damnation on them who truly repent; which makes the constant preaching of Repentance necessary.
15.52.M qut onch matta matcheseonk anue missi paudtauunnate awakompanaonk nag wunnamuhkuttee aiuṣkoiantamohettit, kah yeu wutch ayimmooooash nagwutteae kuhkootomoadtin aiuṣkoiantamooonk ne anue quenauhuagk.

16.0.E {Of Good Works.}
16.0.M {Papaume Wunnanakausuongash.}

16.11.E GOOD works are only such as God hath commanded in his holy word, and not such as without the warrant thereof are devised by men out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intentions.
16.11.M WUnnanakausuongash webe yeush nish God annooteamutchish ut wunneetupanatamwe wuttinnoowaonganit, kah matta yeush nish namehteamukish asuh mishkomukish nashpe wosketompaog nashpe pogkinnumoe kissoppitteae kodtantamooonk, asuh nashpe nishnoh adtohtoonk wunne kodtantamooongash.

16.21.E These good works done in obedience to Gods commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and lively Faith, and by them Believers manifest their thankfulness, strengthen their assurance, edifie their Brethren, adorn the profession of the Gospel, stop the mouthes of the adversaries, and glorifie God, whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto, that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end eternal life.
16.21.M Yeush wunnanakausuongash usseenash noswehtamunate Manittooe annooteamooongash nish meechummuongash, kah kuhkinneasuongash wunnamuhkuttee kah pomantamooe wunnamptamooonk, kah yeush nashpe wunnamptoggeeg woshwunnumauoog wuttabuttantamooonganoo, menuhkheoog uppahkontamwe annoosuonganoo, wekkekonittuog oowemattittuonganoo, sohsumwaheoog oonaunchemookae sampooaonk, kah kuphamauaog wuttoonooash aiyeukonukqhetticheh, kah sohsumoounnaog God, noh ukkezteauoh nashpe Christ en wunnakausuongash, onk ahtauhettit wunneetupanatamwe meechumuongash woh ahtauog wohkukquoshik micheme pomantamooonk.

16.31.E Their ability to doe good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ:
16.31.M Wunnamptoggeeg tapenumwaheoog ussenat wunnanakausuoṇgash, matta toh hen wutch nehenwonche nagumau, qut mamusseyeue wutch Wunnashauanittoomoh Christ. 

16.32.E And that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual influence of the same holy Spirit to work in them to will and to doe, of his good pleasure; 
16.32.M Kah onk woh tapenumwaheoog wunneusseenate chonchippe monaneteaongash nish mahche attumunumhettupash usseae menuhkesuonk wutch yeu nane Nashauanit quenauhuagk anakausuwehtauonate wehkontamunate kah usseenate, neaunak wunne Manitoe tapeneamooonk. 

16.33.E yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.
16.33.M Qut onch yeu wutch matta woh nanompanusseog onatuh matta anonoog ussenat nishnoh wunnoswehtamooonk, qut webe nashpe wogkauanittamooonk Manittoe [N]ashauanit, qut woh menehteanittamwog wogkouanittamunat Manittooe monaneteaonk ne appetunkqhettit.

16.41.E They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and to doe more then God requires, as that they fall short of much, which in duty they are bound to doe.
16.41.M Nag ahtauhettit nashpe wunnoswehtamooonganoo anue mohsakish noswehtamoe chippaiyeuash nish nishnoh missinnin woh ahtou yeuut pomantamooonganit, noonenumwog moocheke ussenate onk ne God anooteamit, nux nootonumwog ussenate yeush wunnoswehtamooongash nish God anoononcheh.

16.51.E We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them, and the glory to come;

16.52.E and the infinite distance that is between us, and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor satisfie for the debt of our former sins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants:
16.52.M kah mat wohkukquoshik naosukkoadtuonk ne nashaue nenawun, kah God noh nunnoonenumumun wutchaiyeuwononate nashpe noonanakausuonganunnonash, asuh taphumunate wutch nukkone matcheseae nutinontaquawhutteaonganunonash, qut usseog wame woh ne aseog nutusseemun webe nunnoswehtamooonganun mat toh unnompamukqussue wuttinninneumeneunk. 

16.53.E And because as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit, and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with so much weakness and imperfection, that they cannot endure the severity of Gods judgement.

16.61.E Yet notwithstanding, the persons of Believers being accepted through Christ, their good works also are accepted in him, not as though they were in this life wholly unblameable and unreproveable in Gods sight, but that he looking upon them in his Son is pleased to accept & reward that which is sincere, although accompanied with many weaknesses & imperfections.

16.72.E yet because they proceed not from an heart purified by Faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the Word, nor to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, nor make a man meet to receive grace from God, and yet their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing to God.

17.11.E THey whom God hath accepted in his beloved, effectually called and sanctified by his Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but shall certainly persevere therein to the end, & be eternally saved.
17.11.M YEuuh God attumunoncheh ut womonegane Wunnaumonuh, & menuhkesue wehkomoncheh kah wunneetupanatamwaheoncheh nashpe Wunnashauanittoomoh, matta woh mamusseyeue asuh wohkukquoshinnooe penushaog wutche monaneteae wuttinniyeuonk, qut wunnamuhkuttee pish nagwutteaeyeuooog kah micheme wadchanoog.

17.21.E This Perseverance of the Saints depends not upon their own free-will, but upon the immutability of the Decree of Election, from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father upon the efficacy of the merit and intercession of Jesus Christ, & union with him, the Oath of God, the abiding of his Spirit, and the seed of God within them, and the nature of the covenant of Grace, from all which ariseth also the certainty and infallibility thereof.

17.31.E And though they may through the temptation of Satan, & of the world, the prevalency of Corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of the means of their preservation, fall into grievous sins, and for a time continue therein, whereby they incur Gods displeasure, and grieve his holy Spirit, come to have their graces and comforts impaired, have their hearts hardned, and their Consciences wounded, hurt and scandalize others, and bring temporal judgements upon themselves;

18.0.M {Papaume Pahkontamoe anoosuonk Monaneteank kah Wadchanittuonk}.

18.11.E ALthough temporary believers, & other unregenerate men may vainly deceive themselvs with false hopes & carnal presumptions of being in the favour of God, and state of salvation, which hope of theirs shall perish;
18.11.M TOhkonogque ahquompiyeue wunnamptoggeeg, kah onkatoggeeg mat nompe neekitcheg woh tahnooche asookekommaog wuhhogkauh nashpe pannoowae annoosuongash, & weyausue natwontamooongash papaume wutahtauonganoo Manittooe oowomoausuonk, kah wadchanittue wuttinniyeuonk, ne wutanoosuonk pish paguadtauun; 

18.11.E yet such as truly believe in the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavouring to walk in all good conscience before him may in this life be certainly assured that they are in the state of grace, and may rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God, which hope shall never make them ashamed.
18.12.M qut onch nag wunnamuhkutteyeue wunnamptamohettit ut Lord Jesus, kah pahketeahae womonahettit, kah kodpomushahettit ut wame wunnegen ummehquontamwutteahaonganit ut anaquabit, woh yeuut pomantamooonganit attumunoog pahkontamwe annoosuonk papaume wuttahtauonganoo monaneteae wuttinniyeuonk, kah woh miskouanatamwog ut anoosuonganit wussohsumooonk God, kah ne anoosuonk mat wutakodchuwahikkoounneau.

18.21.E This certainty is not a bare conjectural and probable perswasion, grounded upon a fallible hope, but an infallible assurance of faith, founded on the blood and righteousness of Christ, revealed in the Gospel, and also upon the inward evidence of those graces unto which promises are made, and on the immediate witness of the Spirit, testifiing our Adoption, and as a fruit thereof, leaving the heart more humble and holy.
18.21.M Yeu wunnamuhkutteyeuuk matta tahnooche pah paquadcheyeue nupweshassooaonganinnoo aiyimuk nashpe asookekodteamooe anoosuonk, qut mat asookekodteamooe pahontamwe wunnamptamooe annoosuonganuoo, ne oomoooo wutche oosqheonk kah sampweseonk Christ, woshwunnumuk ut oonaunchemookae wuttinnoowaonk, kah wutche ennometahae wauwak[on]onk yeush monaneteaongash nish en Manittoe quoshodtuongash kezteaumukish, kah wutche pahke wauwaonk Wunnashauanittoomoh God, ne pohquttuk Noonaumonakonitteaonganun, uttiyeu nashpe metah anue moocheke hohpateauun, kah wunneetupanatamwahteauun.

18.31.E This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of Faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficultyes before he be partaker of it; yet being inabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may without extraordinary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means attain thereunto:
18.31.M Yeu matta asookekodteamooe pahkontamwe annoosuonk matta tatuppeyeuewutchiinnoo en wutteagqunnooooonganit Wunnamptamooonk, qut wunnamuhkuttee wunnamptamwaen woh sepe pahtussu, kah woh nogkushkom mishe unkqueneunkquokish asquam yeu attumunumook, qut onch tapenumwaheont nashpe Nashauanit wahteauunate teanteaguassinish nanowe enninnumauomukish wutch Godut, yeu pahkontamwe anoosuonk woh attumunumun nashpe sampwi auwahteaouk nanwe aninnumoadtuongash, ne tohut Manittooe oowoshwunnumooongash, 

18.31.E And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure, that thereby his heart may be inlarged in peace & joy in the holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and cheerfulness in the duties of obedience, the proper fruits of this assurance; so far is it from inclining men to looseness.
18.32.M kah yowutche noswehtamooonganuoo nishnoh missinnin menuhke ussenate oowehkomoowaonk, kah uppepenamooonk, onk ne nashpe wuttah woh misheteauun ut wunnohteaonk, kah miskouanatamooonk wunneetupanatamwe Nashauanit, ut womonittuonk kah tabuttantamooonk en Godut, kah ut menuhkesuonk kah taphettuonk, ut oonanchemookae noswehtamooongash nish nanahsiyeue meechumuonganuooash pahkontamwe annoosuonk, ne matta unnanumooun tahnooche pomantamunate.

18.41.E True Believers may have the assurance of their salvation divers wayes shaken diminished and intermitted, as by negligence in preserving of it, by falling into some special sin, which woundeth the Conscience, and grieveth the Spirit, by some sudden or vehement temptation, by Gods withdrawing the light of his countenance, suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness, and to have no light;
18.41.M Pahkontamwe annoosuonk ne wunnamuhkuttee wunnamptogeek ahtauog papaume oowadchanaonganoo woh moocheke chippee nunnukshadtauun, pewehteauun, & papamshadtauun, neane nashpe mat nanawontamwe nanawehtinnate, asuh nashpe uppenushaonganoo ut nawhutche nanasiyeue matcheseonk, ne noochumwehtahamoooo mehquontamwutteahaonk, kah neuantamwaheau Wunnashauanittoomoh God, asuh nashpe nawhutche tiadche, kah ahchue Qutchuwaonk asuh nashpe amauunumooonk wequaiyeue Lordeue wuttinussuonk, ne nashpe quashoncheeg God pomshaog pohkenahtu, kah matta wequaiyeumooog, 

18.42.E yet are they neither utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of Faith, that love of Christ and the Brethren, that sincerity of heart and conscience of duty, out of which by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may in due time be revived, and by the which in the mean time they are supported from utter despair.
18.42.M qut matta wameyeue quenauhikkooog Manittooe ooskanneem, Wunnamptamoe pomantamoonk, ne womoausuonk Christ, kah weemattineunk, ne pahketeahaonk, & mehquontamwutteahae noswehtamooonk, yeush wutch nashpe Nashauanittue wutanakausuonk yeu pahkontamwe annoosuonk woh wonk pomantamwahteauun; kah uttiyeush nashpe ahquompiyeue wadchanoog wutch mat-annooseinnate.

19.0.E {Of the Law of God.}
19.0.M {Papaume Manittooe Naumatuonk.}

19.11.E GOD gave to {Adam} a Law of universal obedience written in his heart, and a particular precept of not eating the fruit of the tree of Knowledge of good and evil, as a Covenant of Works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact and perpetual obedience, promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatned death upon the breach of it, and indued him with power and ability to keep it.
19.11.M GOD enninnumauop {Adam} nanowe noswehtamooe Naumatuonk ne wussukwhosu ut wuttahhut, kah nanassiyeue annooteamooonk mat meechuinnate mehtukque meechummuonkwahteaumuk wanegik kah machuk, neane anakausuongane Wunnoowaonk, yeu nashpe annooteamoo God kishpissue {Adam} kah wame wuttinneetuonk howanooooe, mamuseyeue, piuhsuke, kah nagwutteae noswehtamunate, kah quoshomop pomantamooonk noswehtamohettit kah ukquogquohtomuh nuppooonk pohqunnumhettit yeu naumatuonk, kah tapenumwaheau yeu ussenate.

19.21.E This Law so written in the heart, continued to be a perfect Rule of righteousness after the fall of man, & was delivered by God on mount Sinai in ten Commandments, and written in two Tables;
19.21.M Yeu Naumatuonk neaneyeuwe wussukwhosu ut wosketompae wuttahut nagwutteohteau mache wosketompae penushaonk piuhsuke kah sampweseae kuhkuhheeg, kah ompetak nashpe God magun ut Sinaie wadchuut, ut piogquttash annooteamooongash, kah wussukwhosu ut neesinash Tablesash; 

19.21.E  the four first Commandments containing our duty towards God, and the other six our duty to man.

19.31.E Beside this Law commonly called Moral, God was pleased to give to the people of Israel, as a Church under age, Ceremonial Laws, containing several Typical Ordinances, partly of Worship, prefiguring Christ, his Graces, Actions, Sufferings and benefits, and partly holding forth divers Instructions of moral Dutyes:
19.31.M God matta webe enninnumauop yeu Naumatuonk ne hettamuk mat osoowunnamooe asuh Moral Naumatuonk, qut onch tapeneam enninnumauonate Israelle missinninnuog neane nootowekooe moeuwehkomunk Ceremonialle asuh osoowunnamooe Naumatuongash, nish woshwunnumunkqueagish monatash kuhkinneasue, kah wowossumooe Kuhkoowaongash kuhkinneasuonganeuooash Christ, Ummonaneteaongash Wutusseongash, Wuttamehpunaongash, kah wunnegenuongash peaonukqueagish wutch Christ, kah woshwunnumunkqueagish monatash kuhkootomuhteaongash papaume mat osowunnamooe asuh Moralle noswehtamooongash; 


19.32.E All which Ceremonial Laws being appointed only to the time of Reformation, are by Jesus Christ the true Messiah and onely Law-giver, who was furnished with power from the Father for that end, abrogated and taken away.
19.32.M Wame nish Ceremonialle asuh osowunnamoe Naumatuongash annooteamooongash webe no pajeh wusketeaongane ahquompiyeuoout pohqunnumunash, & amaunumunash nashpe Christ wunnamuhkuttee Messiah, kah webeyeue Naumatuonganehteaenin, noh attumunuk menuhkesuok wutch Wutooshimau yeu wutch natwongamooonganit.

19.41.E To them also he gave sundry Judicial Laws, which expired together with the state of that People, not obliging any now by virtue of that Institution, their general equity only being stil of moral use.
19.41.M Yeu wonk enninnummauop monatash oosittumooe Naumatuongash, nish moae amaunumunash nashpe wuttinniyeuonk yeug missinninnuog, kah mat annooteamooe kishpissinnooash nishnoh howan nashpe ukkuhquttumooe menuhkesuonk, qut webe wunnanwe sampweusseonganoo nagwutteahteau wutch mat osowunnumoe asuh Moralle kuhkooktomuhteaonk.

19.51.E The Moral Law doth for ever bind all, as well justified persons as others, to the obedience thereof;

19.52.E and that not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the Authority of God the Creator, who gave it:
19.52.M kah ne matta webe wutche wutteagweyeuooonk na ohtagk, qut onch wutche Ummenuhkesuonk God noh wame kezteunk, noh yeu ayik Naumatuonk, 

19.53.E neither doth Christ in the Gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation.
19.53.M Kah Christ ut wunaunchemonkae wuttinnoowaonk matta wutamaunnumooun, qut moocheke menuhketeauun yeu annooteamooe kishkpissuonk.

19.61.E Although true Believers be not under the Law, as a Covenant of Works, to be thereby justified or condemned, yet it is of great use to them as well as to others, in that, as a Rule of life, informing them of the Will of God, and their duty, and directs and binds them to walk accordingly, discovering also the sinfull pollutions of their nature, hearts and lives, so as examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of humiliation for, and hatred against sin, together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of his obedience.
19.61.M Tohkonogque wunnamuhkuttee Wunnamptoggeeg mat agwoppehheoog Naumatuonk neane anakausuongane Wunnoowaonk kah yeu nashpe matta sampweneheoog asuh awakompanaheoog, qut onch moocheke oonenehikqunneau kah onkatoggeeg, nanahsiyeue, newaj neane pomantamooe kuhkuhheeg oowahteauwahikqunneau papaume wuttenantamooonk God, kah wunnoswehtamooonganoo kah ukkuhkootamunkqunneau, kah ukkishpinukquneau pomushonate neaunak wuttenantamooonk God, kah oowoshwunnumunkqunneau matcheseae, nishkeneunkqussuongash wuttinnepomantamooonganooout wuttahhoowout, kah wuttinniyeuonganooout, kah yeu nashpe ennih natootamauahettit nehenwonche wuhhogkauh, woh attumunumwog nano moocheke wunnomwahettuonk papaume matcheseonk, wuttahohpooonk wutch matcheseonk kah sekeneamuonk aiyeukone matcheseonk kah anue pahke naumooonk ukquenauhikooonganoo Christoh, kah wunnegenuooonk Christue wunnoswehtamooonk 

19.62.E It is likewise of use to the Regenerate, to restrain their corruptions, in that it forbids sin, and the threatnings of it serve to shew what even their sins deserve, and what afflictions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the curse thereof threatned in the Law. The promises of it in like manner shew them Gods approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, although not as due to them by the Law, as a Covenant of Works;
19.62.M kah netatuppe oonenehikqunneau wuttattanumunate wutanninnooonganooash, newaj yeu naumatuonk quehtehteaumoo matcheseonk, kah ukquogquohtoaongash yeu naumatuonk nahtehteaumooash wuttumhouaongash ummatcheseonganoooash, kah chaque onkapunnaongash woh natawompatamwog yeuut pomantamooonganit wutche ummatcheseonganoooash tohkonogque chippinninnuwaheoog wutche mattanittuonk ne quogquohtoadt Naumatuonk, Naumatu[o]gane quoshodtuongash netatuppe natehteaumooash manittooe wuttapeneamooonk noswehtamooonk, kah chagwe wunnanittuongash woh annoosuog ussehettit, tohkonogque yeush wunnanittuongash mat wutunnontukquohamoounash wutche Naumatuonk neane anakausuongane Wunnoowaonk; 

19.63.E so as a mans doing good, and refraining from evil, because the Law encourageth to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his being under the Law, and not under Grace.
19.63.M Kah tohkonohque Naumatuonk menehteanittamwaheau woṣketompaog wunesenate, kah mishanehheau ussenate matcheseonk, qut wosketomp wunneseit kah ahqueteau matchesenate, yeu matta pohquttummoomunoo wosketomp agwoppehteau Naumatuonk, kah matta agwoppehteau Monaneteaonk.

19.71.E Neither are the forementioned uses of the Law contrary to the grace of the Gospel, but doe sweetly comply with it, the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to doe that freely and chearfully which the will of God revealed in the Law required to be done.
19.71.M Negonne keketookontamugkish Naumatuongane auwahteaongash mat aiyeukontamooash wunnaunchemookae monaneteaonk, qut yeu nashpe wekonne weetoowottoomooash, Wunnashauanittoomoh Christ sohkauont, kah tapenumwaheont woṣketompae wuttenantamooonk nanowe kah wekontame ussenate ne wuttenantamooonk God woshwunnumuk ut Naumatuonganit annooteamoo ussenate.

20.11.E THE Covenant of Works being broken by sin and made unprofitable unto life, God was pleased to give unto the Elect the promise of Christ; the seed of the Woman, as the means of calling them, and begetting in them Faith & Repentance:
20.11.M ANakausuongane Wunnoowaonk pohquenumun nashpe matcheseonk, mo matta wutchayeuonganunnoo en pomantamunate; Qut God tapeneam enninnummauunate Pepenauitcheg quoshodtuonk papaume Chirst Mittamwossisse ooskanneem, wutche anninnumoadtinnate wehkomonaout, kah aiyimauonaout wunnamptamooonk, & aiuskoiantamoook. 

20.12.E in this promise, the Gospel, as to the substance of it, was revealed, and was therein effectual for the conversion and salvation of sinners.
20.12.M Yeuut quoshodtuonganit Wunnaunchemookaonk wutche wutteagweyeuooonk woshwunnumauonaop, kah yeu nashpe tapenummoooo wutche quinuppeonk, kah wadchanittuonk matcheseaenuog.

20.21.E This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only in and by the Word of God; 
20.21.M Yeu quoshodtuonk papaume Christ & wadchanittuonk nashpe nagum, webe woshwunnumuk ut kah nashpe Wuttinnoowaonk God. 

20.22.E neither doe the works of Creation or Providence, with the light of Nature, make discovery of Christ, or of Grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way; much less that men destitute of the revelation of him by the Promise or Gospel, should be enabled thereby to attain saving Faith or Repentance.
20.22.M Kezteau kah nanawontamooe anakausuongash nashpe wuttinne pomantamooongane wequai, matta woshwunnummoomunooash Christ, asuh Mananeteaonk nashpe nagum, matchaog, matta ne nanwe asuh pohkinnumooe enniyeuonganit, anue ogguhse wosketompaog mat ahtauoogeeg woshwunnumooonk papaume Christ, nashpe Wunnaunchemokae quoshodtuonk, tapenumwaheoog nashpe wuttinne pomantamooongane wequai ahtauunate wadchanittue Wunnamptamooonk kah aiuskoiantamooonk.

20.31.E The revelation of the Gospel unto sinners made in divers times and by sundry parts, with the addition of Promises and Precepts for the obedience required therein, as to the nations and persons to whom it is granted, is meerly of the soveraign will and good pleasure of God, not being annexed by virtue of any promise to the due improvement of mens natural abilityes, by virtue of common light received without it, which none ever did make, or can so doe:
20.31.M Wunnaunchemokae woshwunnumauaonk moochekit nompe kah moocheke chippee matcheseaenuog woshwunnumuk, nashpe quoshodtuongane kah Annooteamooe kootnehteaonk wutche noswehtamooonk yeuut annoonittimmuk, natwontamog wutohtimoneash, kah missinninnuog nah Wunnaunchemokaonk God oowoshwunnumauau, yeu webe wutch sontimooe wuttenantamooonk kah wunnegenue wuttapeneamooonk God, kah matta toh hen kishpissue quoshautooun wunnegenue auwahteauunnate wosketompae wuttinnepomantamooongane tapenumooongash; nashpe menuhkesuok wuttinnepomantamooongane wequai ne tohhut Wunnaunchemookaonk attumunumk; tohkonogque matta howan auwahteauoop asuh tapenum wame auwahkonate nehenwonche wuttinnepomantamooongane tapenumooongash, 

20.32.E And therefore in all Ages the Preaching of the Gospel hath been granted unto Persons and Nations, as to the extent or straightning of it, in great variety, according to the Counsel of the Will of God.
20.32.M kah newaj Wunnaunchemookae kuhkootomoadtin ut wame ohontseongash enninnumoadtinnape missinninnuog kah wutohtimoinneash ne wehque Wunnaunchemookae misseken, asuh nattauadt ut mishe eianeyeuuk neaunak kogkohqutteamooonk Manittooe wuttenantamooonk.

20.41.E Although the Gospel be the only outward means of revealing Christ and saving Grace, & is, as such, abundantly sufficient thereunto; yet that men who are dead in trespasses, may be born again, quickned or regenerated, there is moreover necessary an effectual, irresistible work of the holy Ghost upon the whole soul, for the producing in them a new spiritual life, without which no other means are sufficient for their conversion unto God.

21.11.E THE Liberty which Christ hath purchased for Believers under the Gospel, consist, in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God, the rigor and curse of the Law, and in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin, from the evil of afflictions, the fear and sting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation; as also in their free access to God, and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind:
21.11.M WUtchippinnuooonk ne Christ tapewhuk wutche Wunnamptamwaenuog wutchayeumoo ut wutchippinnuonganoo kesukkoadtamwe matcheseonk, awakompanae musquantamooonk God, menuhkeseue, kah mattanittue Naumatuonk, kah ut pohquohwhunnaonganoo wutche yeu matcheseae muttaok; missinnooooonk en Mattnnittuut, menuhkesuonk matcheseonk; wutche machuk onkapunnaongash, wutche wabesuonk, kah wutchohhuwaonk nuppooonk, wutche sohkausuonk weenohke, kah micheme awakompanaonk, kah wonk ut wunnanowe peyaonaonganoo God kah wunnoswehtauaonganoo, matta wutch missinnooe wabesuonk, qut wutch mukkiesue womonaonk, kah wekontamwe unnanetamooonk:

21.12.E All which were common also to Believers under the Law, for the substance of them, but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further inlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, the whole legal administration of the Covenant of Grace, to which the Jewish Church was subjected, and in greater boldness of access to the throne of Grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, then Believers under the Law did ordinarily partake of.
21.12.M Wame yeush wutchiyeumooash wunnamptamwachuog ut agwe Naumatuonganit wutche wutteagweyeuooonganoo, Qut ut agwe Wuske Testament Christiannue chippinnuooonk anue moocheke mishehteauun, ut wutchippinninnuooonganoo wutche Yoke Ceremonialle asuh osoowunnumooe Naumatuonk, kah wutche mamusse naumatue chadchaubenumooe usseonk Monaneteae Wunnoowaonk, uttiyeu Jewse Moeuwehkomunk agwoppehheonk, kah ut anue missi kah mat qussee pyeaonaonk en Monaneteae appuonganit, kah ut anue missiyeue ahtoongash nanowe Wunnashauanittoomoh God, onk wunnamptamwaenuog ut agwe Naumatuonk nonagwutteae ahtauopanneg.

21.21.E God alone is Lord of the Conscience, and hath left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of men, which are in any thing contrary to his Word, or not contained in it;
21.21.M God noh webe Lordoooo Mequontamwutteahaonk kah chippinnuwaheau mehquantamwutteahaonk wutch wosketompae kuhkootomwehteaonk, kah annooteamooongash, uttiyeuash aiyeuuhkontamooooash Wuttinnoowaonk God nishnoh ut teague enniyeuonk, asuh mat ut wuttinnoowaonk: 

21.22.E so that to believe such Doctrines, or to obey such Commands out of Conscience, is to betray true liberty of Conscience, and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy Liberty of Conscience, and Reason also.
21.22.M Kah yeu wutch ennih woṣketompaog mehquontamwutteahae wunnamptamohettit neonagish kuhkootomwehteaongash, asuh noswehtamohettit neonagish annooteamooongash, wunnassootamwog wunnamuhkuttee mehquontam wutteahae chippinninnuooonk kah anooteamunate mat wahteaue wu[n]tamptamooonk kah mamusseyeue pogkinumooe noswehtamooonk yeu pagwadtauunate matta webe mehquontamwutteahae chippinninnuooonk, qut onch ennomaiyeuonk.

21.31.E They who upon pretence of Christian Liberty doe practice any sin, or cherish any lust, as they doe thereby pervert the main design of the Grace of the Gospel to their own destruction; 
21.31.M Nag woskeche nogqussitcheeg Christiannue chippinninnuooonk ussehettit nishnoh matcheseonk, asuh wekontamohettit nishnoh matchekodtantamoonk, nag kepuhteaog negonneyeue achuwontamooonk Wuunaunchemokae Monaneteaonk en nehenwonche paguanuonganuout,

21.32.E so they wholly destroy the end of Christian Liberty, which is that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the dayes of our life.
21.32.M kah mamusseyeue paguanuog ennomai Christianinnue chippinninnuooonk ne nuppohwhunnitteamun wutch wunnutcheganit nummatwomunnonog mat woh wabesue noowowussummomun God ut wunneetupanatamooonk, kah sampweseonk ut anaquabit wame nukkesukodtumunnonash nesahke pomantamog.

22.0.E {Of Religious Worship, and of the Sabbath-day.}
22.0.M {Papaume Manittoowompae Wowussummuaonk, kah papaume Sabbath$dayik.}

22.11.E THE light of Nature sheweth that there is a God, who hath Lordship and Soveraignty over all, is just, good, and doth good unto all, and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and served with all the heart and all the soul, and with all the might,
21.11.M WUttinnepomantamooongane wequai wahteauwahuwomoo na Godoooo, noh Lordoooo, kah Sontimoooo, ut kenugke wame kah noh sampwesu wunneetu kah wunnenehuwaenuoo wame, kah yowutche yeu woṣketompae wunnoswetamooonk, qushonate, womononate, waeenomonate, peantamauonate, pabahtanumonate, & wowussumonate nashpe mamusse metahhut, kah mamusse keteahogkounit, kah nashpe wame menuhkesuonganit.

22.12.E But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will, that he may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representations, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scripture.
21.12.M Qut wekontamwe enniyeuonk wowussumonate God ne annooteamit nashpe nehenwoṇche nagum, kah tatuppeyeue kuhquttuk nashpe wunnehenwonche wahteauwahuwaonk wuttenantamooonk, onk wosketompaog matta woh wowussumaooog neaunak nehenwonche wuttenantamooonganoo, asuh wutassootue mequontamooonganoo, asuh mattannittue qutchuwaongash, ut agwe nishnoh nogqussue ogqueneunkqussuongash, asuh nishnoh wonkatuk enniyeuonk matta annoonitteumuk ut wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganit.

22.21.E Religious Worship is to be given to God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, and to him alone; not to Angels, Saints, or any other Creatures; and since the Fall, not without a Mediator, nor in the Mediation of any other but of Christ alone.
21.21.M Woh Manittoowompae noowowussumomun God, Wutooshimau, Wunnaumoniin, kah wunneetupanatamwe Nashauanit, kah webe nagum, matta Angelsog, wunneetupanatogeeg, asuh nishnoh onkatoggeeg oowaasineeg, kah mahche wosketompae penushaonk matta woh noowussumomun God netohhut Wunnohteahawaenin, kah matta ut Wunnohteahettuonk nishnoh onkatogk, qut Christ webe.

22.31.E Prayer with thanksgiving, being one special part of natural worship, is by God required of all men; but that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of his Spirit, according to his Will, with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance: and when with others, in a known tongue.
22.31.M Peantamooonk nashpe tabuttantamooonk, ne pasuk nanahsiyeue chippe wuttinnepomantamooongane wowussumuaonk, kah nashpe God annooteamit wutche wame missinninnuog, qut onch woh tapeneammuk, woh peantamwog ut oowesuonganit Wunnaumoniin, nashpe anninnummoadtuonk wunneetupanatamwe Nashauanit, neaunak wuttenantamooonk God, naspe wohwohtamoonk, qushaonk, hohpooonk, kisopetteahaonk, wunnamptamooonk, womonittuonk, kah nagwutteahteaonk, kah peantamohettit weeche onkatoggeeg ut wahteaue unnontowaonganit.

22.41.E Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter, but not for the dead, nor for those of whom it may be known that they have sinned the sin unto death.
22.41.M Peantamooonk woh aiyimun wutch wame wunneegenue naumatue teanteaguassinish, kah wutche wame eiyane missinninnuog pomantoggeeg, asuh woh ompetak pomantoggeeg, qut matta wutch napukkeeg asuh yeug uttiyeug papaume woh noowaheomun matchesepanneg en nuppooonganit,

22.51.E The reading of the Scriptures, Preaching and hearing of the word of God, singing of Psalms, as also the administration of Baptism and the Lords Supper, are all parts of religious worship of God, to be performed in obedience unto God with understanding, faith, reverence and godly fear.
22.51.M Ogketamooonk wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganit, Kuhkootomoadtuonk kah wuttinnoowaonk God, kotohomaonk Psalmsash, kah wonk manittoowompae usseonk Kitchissumooonk, kah Lordooe Mishadtuppooonk, wame yeush chippiyeuash manittoowompae wowussummaonk God, kah woh usseenash en noswehtauonat God, nashpe wohwohtamooonk, wunnamptamooonk, wabesuonk, kah manittooe qushaonk. 

22.52.E Solemn Humiliations with Fastings, and Thanksgiving upon special occasions, are in their several times and seasons to be used in an holy and religious manner.
22.52.M Qushae Hohpooongash nashpe Matmeetsuongash, kah Tabuttantamooonk ut nanahsiyeue ahquompiyeuash, woh moochekit nompe auwahteaunash, ut wunnetupanatamwe kah manittoowompae enniyeuonk.

22.61.E Neither Prayer, nor any other part of religious Worship, is now under the Gospel either tyed unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed: 
22.62.M Peantamooonk, asuh nishnoh wonkatog chippe manittoowompae Wowussummuwaonk yeuyeu ut agwe wunnaunchemookaonk matta kishpissinnoo nishnoh en aiyeuonganit, asuh anue moocheke tapehikkooun God, newaj usseen asuh yeuut, asuh ut onkatog aiyeuonganit, asuh newaj sampwashanum nogque en yeu, asuh wonkatog aiyeuonganit:

22.62.E but God is to be worshiped every where in spirit and in truth, as in private familyes daily, and in secret each one by himself, so more solemnly in the publick Assemblyes, which are not carelesly nor wilfully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God by his word or providence calleth thereunto.
22.62.M Qut God woh nashauanittue kah wunnamuhkuttee wowossumon nishnoh ut aiyeuonganit matta webe kesukodae nishnoh ut, chachashiyeuonganit, kah kemeyeue nashpe nishnoh missinnin, qut onch anue quoshae ut miyaeu Mukkinneongash, nish matta woh mattoh hen tuppanatamwe, asuh unnantamwae sekeneamoomunooash asuh ahquanumoomunooash; God wehkomont naen nashpe wuttinnoowaonk, asuh nashpe wunnanawontamooonk.

22.71.E As it is of the law of Nature, that in general a proportion of time by Gods appointment be set apart for the worship of God; so by his Word in a positive, moral and perpetual commandment, binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week, 
22.71.M Neyane nanweyeue neaunak wuttinnepomantamooongane naumatuonk nawhutche ahquompi nashpe Manittooe annooteamooonk woh chippe ponamun wutch wowussumonate God, tatuppeyeue nashpe wuttinnowaonk God ut ponamooe mat osowunnumoe kah nagwutteohteae annooteamooonk kishpinnont wame missinninnuog ut wame ahontseongash nanahsiyeue annooteamit pasuk kesukod wutche nishnoh nesausuk tashinash kesukodtash wutche Wussabbatoom, ne woh wunneetupanatamwe nanawehteamuk, ne mo maumachish kesukod nishnoh weekoout wutche kezteausik Muttaok en wutomohkeonganit Christ; 

22.72.E and from the resurrection of Christ was changed into the first day of the week, which in Scripture is called the Lords day, and is to be continued to the end of the world as the Christian Sabbath, the observation of the last day of the week being abolished.
22.72.M kah wutch wutomohkeonganit Christ mo oosowunnamun en negonne kesukod nishnoh weekoout ne ut wunneetupanatamwe wussukwhonganit hettamuk Lordue Kesukod, kah mo nagwutteohteau no pajeh wohkukquoshik Muttaok neane Christiane Sabbath, nanawehteamuk maumachish Kesukod nishnoh weekoout mahche amaunumuk.

22.81.E This Sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men after a due preparing of their hearts, and ordering their common affairs beforehand, do not only observe an holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldly imployments and recreations, but also are taken up the whole time in the publick and private exercises of his Worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.
22.81.M Neit missinninnuog wunneetupanatamwe nanawehteaog yeu Wussabbatoom en Lordut, sampweseae quagwashwehtamohettit wuttahhoooash, kah negonnae wunnohtouhettit uppissaiyeuonganoooash, matta webe nanawehteauog wunneetupanatamwe anwohsinnooonk qunnikesuk wutche wame nehenwonche wutanakausuonganoooash, ukkuttooonganoooash, & wuttenantamooonganoooash papaume ummuttaohke uppissaiyeuonganoooash kah uppompooonganoooash, qut onch auwahteaog mamusse ahquompi ut moyaeu kah kemeyeue wowussummuwae peantamweseongash, kah ut quenauhikkooe kah monaneteae anakausuongash.

23.0.E {Of lawfull Oaths and Vows.}
23.0.M {Papaume wunnegonnue naumatue Chadchekeyeuaongash kah chadchekeyeuae Quoshaumuaongash.}

23.11.E A Lawful Oath is a part of religious Worship, wherein the person swearing in truth, righteousness and judgement, solemnly calleth God to witness what he asserteth or promiseth, and to judge him according to the truth or falshood of what he sweareth,
23.11.M WUnnegenue Naumatue Chadchekeyeuwaonk chippiyeuoo manittowompae Wowussumuaonk, uttiyeu howane chadchekeimont ut wunnomayeuonganit, sampweseonganit, kah wussittumooonganit, quoshoae wehkomau God wauwonate ne anoowadt, asuh quoshauadt, kah wussumonate neaunak wunnomwayeuonganit, asuh pannoowaonk ne chadchekeyeuadt.

23.21.E The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it is to be used with all holy fear & reverence:
23.21.M Wosketompaog woh chadchekeyeuaog webe nashpe oowesuonk God, kah chadchekeyeuwahettit woh auwaheaog oowesuonk God nashpe wame wunnetupanatamwe qushaonk kah wabesuonk;

23.22.E Therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadfull name, or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinfull, and to be abhorred:
23.22.M Yowutche tahnoocheyeue asuh mat-natwontamooe chadchekeyeuonate nashpe ne sohsumooe kah unkquenunkqussue oowesuonk, asuh chadchekeyeuwonate nishnohut wuttinniyeuonk nashpe nishnoh wonkatog teagq ne ahche matchit, kah jishanumukquodt:

23.23.E yet as in matters of weight and moment an Oath is warranted by the Word of God under the New Testament, as well as under the Old; so a lawful Oath, being imposed by lawful authority in such matters, ought to be taken.
23.23.M qut onch ut missiyeue pissaumatuongash asuh pissaiyeuongash Chadchekeyeuoank tapeneammun nashpe Wuttinnoowaonk God ut agwe Wuske Testament neane agwe Nukkone Testament, kah wosketompaog wehkomitcheg naumatue chadchekeyeuwaonk nashpe naumatue nanawunnoowaonk ut neonagish pissaumatuongash woh chadchekeyeuwaog.

23.31.E Whosoever taketh an Oath warranted by the Word of God, ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully perswaded is the truth:
23.31.M Howan Chadchekeimont neaunak manittoe wussukwhongane sampwunnumooonk woh metahhoowae natwontam missukkenooonk yeu anue quihtamwe usseonk, kah naut monteagq wauwonate qut ne pakodche wunnamptam wunnamuhkutteyeuoo,

23.32.E neither may any man bind himself by Oath to any thing, but what is good & just, and what he believeth so to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform.
23.32.M kah matta howan kishpinnoou wuhhogkauh nishnoh teag ussenate, qut webe ne wunnegenuoo kah sampwiyeuoo, kah ne wunnamptam ne ennih, kah ne tapenum kah kesantam ussenate.

23.33.E Yet it is a sin to refuse an Oath touching any thing that is good and just, being lawfully imposed by Authority.
23.33.M Qut onch ahche matchit sekeneamunate Chadchekeyeuaonk papaume nishnoh wunnegenue kah sampwiyeue teag, nahnaunne naumatue nanawunnoowaonk wehkomont ne ussenate.

23.41.E An Oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words, without equivocation, or mental reservation:
23.41.M Howan Chadchekeimont woh chadchekeyeuwau neaunak pahke kah nanwe wahteaue nauwuttammooonk wuttinnoowaongash, netohut wuttenantamwe attittumooonk.

23.42.E It cannot oblige to sin, but in any thing not sinful being taken it binds to performance, although to a mans own hurt; nor is it to be violated, although made to Hereticks or infidels.
23.42.M Chadchekeyeuwaonk matta kishpinnoou howan matchesenate, qut howan chadchekeimont ut nishnoh teagq matta matchit, kishpissu ussenate, tohkonogque en nehenwonche oowoskhikqunat, kah chadchekeyeuaonk matta woh pohqunnumooun tokonogque aiyimuk weeche mat wunnamptoggeeg neaunak wusskwhongane wunnomwayeuonk, asuh weche mo wunamptamunegeh.

23.51.E A Vow, which is not to be made to any Creature, but God alone, is of the like nature with a promissory Oath, and ought to be made with the like religious care, and to be performed with the like faithfulness.
23.51.M Chadchekeyeue quoshaumaonk matta woh aiyimmooun en nishnoh oowaas, qut webe en Godut kah tatuppeyeuoo quoshomauae chadchekeyeuaonk, kah woh aiyimun nashpe tatuppeyeue manittoowompae nanawontamooonk, kah pakodche ussen nashpe tatuppeyeue wunnomwaeyeuonk.

23.61.E Popish monastical Vows of perpetual single life, professed poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher perfection that they are superstitious and sinful snares, in which no Christian may intangle himself.
23.61.M Antechristiannue Chadchekeyeue quoshaumuaongash papaume nagwutteae, kekompae pomantamooonk, sampooae kuttumungeyeuooonk, kah kuhkuhhegane noswehtamooonk, matta anue missiyeue chippiyeuooash anue qunnunkqui pakodche wunnegenuooonk, qut webe mat annooteamooe kah matcheseae ahpehheonooash uttiyeush ut Christiaenin matta woh pittahwhau wuhhogkuh.

24.0.E {Of the Civil Magistrate.}
24.0.M {Papaume Pissaumatue Nananuwaeninnuog.}

24.11.E GOD the supream Lord and King of all the world, hath ordained civil Magistrates to be under him over the People for his own glory and the publick good;
24.11.M GOD anue qunnunkquiyeue Lord, kah Ketassoot wame muttaok, keihtimope pissaumatue Nananuwaeninnuog ut agwe Nagum nanawunnonate missinninnuog wutch nehenwonche wussohsumooonganit kah wutche wosketompae ooniyeuwontamunaout; 

24.12.E and to this end hath armed them with the power of the sword, for the defence and encouragement of them that doe good, and for the punishment of evil doers.

24.21.E It is lawfull for Christians to accept and execute the office of a Magistrate, when called thereunto: in the management whereof as they ought especially to maintain Piety, Justice and Peace, according to the wholsom Laws of each Commonwealth, so for that end they may lawfully now under the new Testament wage war upon just and necessary occasion.
24.21.M Naumatue wunnegenuoo Christiaeninnuog neemunnumunate kah ussenate nananuwaenue wunnanakausuonk ne adt nag wehkomomukkeeg, kah yeu wunnanakausuonk ussehettit, ne nahnaunne wunnoswehtamooonganoo menuhke nanawontamunate Manittowompooooonk, wussittumooonk, kah wunohteaonk neaunak wunnegenue Naumatuongash nishnoh aiyeuonk, kah yeush wutch natwontamooongash yeuyeu ut agwe Wuṣke Testament woh aiyeuuhkontamwog ne adt sampwiyeue kah quenauhikooe wehkomomukkeeg.

24.31.E They who upon pretence of Christian liberty shall oppose any lawful power, or the lawful exercises of it, resist the Ordinance of God, and for their publishing of such opinions, or maintaining of such practices as are contrary to the Light of Nature, or to the known principles of Christianity, whether concerning faith, worship or conversation, or to the power of godliness, or such erronious opinions or practices, as either in their own nature, or in the manner of publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the external peace and order which Christ hath established in the Church, they may lawfully be called to account, and proceeded against by the censures of the Church, and by the power of the civil Magistrate;
24.31.M Nag aiyeuuhkontoggeeg nishnoh naumatue menuhkesuonk, asuh naumatue menuhkesue wutusseonk nashpe woskeche nogqussuonk Christiane chippinninnuooonk aiyeuuhkontamwog wunnohtoonk God, kah woh ennomaiyeue natootomauoog, kah aiyeuhkontamauoog nashpe Moeuwehkomungane aiyashkonteamooongash, kah nashpe ummenuhkesuonk pissaumatue Nananuwaeninuog, wahteauwahuwahettit asuh menuhketeauhettit neonagish pannoowae manittoowompooongash asuh usseongash nish penooweyeuoogish wuttinne pomantamooongane wequai, asuh wunne wahteaue negonneyeuoogish Christiane Manittowompooonk, asuh papaume wunnamptamooonk wowussummuaonk asuh wosketompae pomushaonk asuh manittowompae menuhkesuonk, asuh wahteauwahuwahettit kah menuheteauhettit neonagish pannoowae manittowompooongash asuh usseongash nish ut wuttinne pomantamooonganooout, asuh ut wahteauwahuwae asuh menuhketeaue enniyeuonk, woskehteauoomooash woskecheyeue wunohteaonk, kah kuhkoowaonk ne Christ menuhketeunkup ut Ummoeuwehkomunganit.

24.32.E yet in such differences about the Doctrines of the Gospel, or wayes of the worship of God, as may befall men exercising a good conscience, manifesting it in their conversation, and holding the foundation, and duely observing the Rules of peace and order, there is no warrant for the Magistrate to abridge them of their liberty.
24.32.M Qut onch ut neonagish chadchaboaongash papaume Wunnaunchemokae kuhkootomuhteaongash, asuh papaume Manittooe Wowussumueae enniyeuonk nish woh wunnamptamooe attummunnumunash nashpe wosketompaog kodnanawehteunkeek wunne mehquontamwutteahaonk, yeu wahteauwahuwahettit ut wunne uppomushaonganoo, kah nanawehteauhettit wunnohteae kah kuhkoowae kuhkuhheganash, matta kuhkuhheganinnoo nananuwaeninnuog wunnemunnumauonat wutchippinninnuooonganoo.

24.41.E It is the duty of People to pray for Magistrates, to honour their persons, to pay them Tribute and other dues, to obey their lawful commands, and to be subject to their authority for conscience sake.

24.42.E Infidelity, or difference in religion, doth not make void the Magistrates just and legal Authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to him: from which ecclesiastical persons are not exempted,

25.0.E {Of Marriage.}
25.0.M {Papaume Weetauadtuonk.}

25.11.E MArriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is it lawful for any man to have more then one wife, nor for any woman to have more then one husband at the same time.

25.21.E Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife, for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue, and of the Church with an holy seed, and for preventing of uncleanness.
25.21.M Weetauadtuonk mo kuhquttumun wutch moae aninnumoadtuonk oowasukkiin, kah ummittamwohsin, kah wutch missinninnue misheneetuonittuonk nashpe naumatue ooṣkaneem, kah wutche Moeuwehkomungane misseekenooonk nashpe manittooe ooskaneem, kah wutche amaunnumunate niskeneunkqussuonk.

25.32.E Yet it is the duty of Christians to marry in the Lord, and therefore such as profess the true reformed Religion, should not marry with Infidels, Papists, or other Idolaters: neither should such as are godly, be unequally yoked by marrying such as are wicked in their life, or maintain damnable Heresie.

25.41.E Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity forbidden in the Word, nor can such incestuous Marriages ever be made lawful by any law of man, or consent of partyes, so as those persons may live together as man and wife.

26.11.E THE Catholick or Universal Church, which is invisible, consists of the whole number of the Elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ the head thereof, and is the Spouse, the Body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.

26.21.E The whole body of men throughout the world, professing the faith of the Gospel, and obedience unto God by Christ according unto it, not destroying their own profession by any Errors everting the foundation, or unholiness of conversation they and their children with them are, and may be called the visible Catholique Church of Christ, although as such it is not intrusted with any Officers to rule or govern over the whole body.

26.31.E The purest Churches under heaven are subject both to mixture and error, and some have so degenerated as to become no Churches of Christ, but Synagogues of Satan:

26.32.E Nevertheless Christ alwayes hath had, and ever shall have a visible Kingdome in this world, to the end thereof, of such as believe in him, and make profession of his name.

26.41.E There is no other Head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ, nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be Head thereof, but is that Antichrist, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself in the Church against Christ, and all that is called God, whom the Lord shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.

26.51.E As the Lord in his care and love towards his Church, hath in his infinite wise providence exercised it with great variety in all ages for the good of them that love him, and his own glory:

26.52.E so according to his promise, we expect that in the latter dayes, Antichrist being destroyed, the Jews called, and the adversaryes of the Kingdome of his dear Son broken, the Churches of Christ being enlarged and edified through a free and plentiful communication of light and grace, shall enjoy in this world a more quiet, peaceable and glorious condition then they have enjoyed.

27.0.E {Of the Communion of Saints.}
27.0.M {Papaume Wetomuaonk Wunnetupanatamweyeuitcheg.}

27.11.E ALL Saints that are united to Jesus Christ their Head by his Spirit and Faith, although they are not made thereby one person with him, have fellowship in his Graces, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection and Glory:
27.11.M WAme wunnetupanatoggeg moosogquehheoog Jesus Christ uppuhkukooout nashpe Wunnashauanittoomoh kah wunnamptamooonk, tohkonogque yeu nashpe mat pasukqunnue howanewaheoog weeche Christ, qut ahtauog wetomuaonk ut Ummonaneteaongash, Wutonkapunaongash, Wunnuppooonganit, Wutomohkeonganit, Wussohsumooonganit,

27.12.E And being united to one another in love, they have communion in each others gifts and graces and are obliged to the performance of such dutyes, publick and private, as doe conduce to their mutual good, both in the inward and outward Man.

27.21.E All Saints are bound to maintain an holy fellowship & communion in the Worship of God, and in performing such other spiritual services as tend to their mutual edification, as also in relieving each other in outward things, according to their several abilityes and necessityes:

27.22.E which communion, though especially to be exercised by them in the relations wherein they stand, whether in Familyes or Churches, yet as God offereth opportunity, is to be extended unto all those who in every place call upon the Name of the Lord Jesus.

28.0.E {Of the Sacraments.}
28.0.M {Papaume Sacramentseongash.}

28.11.E SAcraments are holy Signs and Seals of the Covenant of Grace, immediately instituted by Christ, to represent him and his benefits, and to confirm our interest in him, and solemnly to engage us to the service of God in Christ, according to his word.
28.11.M SAcramentseongash wunnetupatamwe Kuhkinneasuonganoooash, kah Menuhketeasuonganuooash Monaneteae Wunnoowaonk, webe kuhquttumunash nashpe Christ, kuhkinneasuwononate kah wuttumhouaongash, kah menuhketeauunate nutchippiyeumun ut nagum, kah qushae nukkishpinnukqunnate wowussumonate God ut Christut, neaunak wuttinnoowaonk.

28.21.E There is in every Sacrament a spiritual relation, or sacramental union between the sign and the thing signified; whence it comes to pass that the names and effects of the one are attributed to the other.
28.21.M Nishnoh ut Sacramentseonk nashauanittue wuttinniyeuonganuoo asuh Sacramentalle mosogqueonganuoo ut nashaue Kuhkinneauonk, kah ne kuhkinneasimuk, yeu nashpe ennih oowesuongash, wachiyeuukkish pasuk, wonkatog ogquontamauoneau.

28.31.E The grace which is exhibited in or by the Sacraments rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them neither doth the efficacy of a Sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that doth administer it, but upon the work of the Spirit, and the word of Institution, which contains together with a precept authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers.
28.31.M Monanumaonk ne quoshwunnumauut ut kah nashpe Sacramentseongash sampweseae auwahteauunash mat enninnumauoun nashpe nishnoh menuhkesuonk ut Wussacramentseongash kah Wussacramenseongane menuhkseuonk mat oomoounoo wutch wunnetupanatamooonk, asuh wanne kodtantamooonk noh anakausue Sacramentseongash usseen, qut wutch wutanakausuonk Nashauanit, kah Kuhquttumooe wuttinnoowaonk utiyeu nashpe nutattumunumumun kuhkoowaonk anoonont auwahteaonk Sacramentseongash, kah oonaiyeuongane quoshomuaonk wame tapenumwe attumunoacheg.

28.41.E There be only two Sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism & the Lords Supper; neither of which may be dispensed by any but by a Minister of the Word lawfully called.
28.41.M Webe neesinash Sacramentseongash kuhquttamunash nashpe Christ Nullordumun ut Wunnaunchemookaonk Kutchessumooonk, & Lordooe mishadtuppooonk, kah yeush matta woh anakausue ussenash nashpe nishnoh missinnin, qut webe nashpe Nohtompeantog naumatue wehkomomuk nashpe Wuttinnoowaonk.

29.0.E {Of Baptism.}
29.0.M {Papaume Kutchessumooonk.}

29.11.E BAptism is a Sacrament of the New Testament, ordained by Jesus Christ, to be unto the party baptized a sign and seal of the Covenant of Grace, of his ingraffing into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of his giving up unto God through Jesus Christ to walk in newness of life; 
29.11.M KUtchessumooonk ne Wusku Testamantue Sacramentseonganuoo ukkuhquttumun nashpe Jesus Christ, wutche menuhketeausue kuhkinneasuonk noh kutchessumit Monaneteae Wunnoowaonk, wunnompenaonk en Christut, nompe neetuonk, ahquontausuonk matcheseongash, kah ummagunate wuhhogkuh en Godut nashpe Jesus Christ pomshonate ut wuske pomantamooonganit;

29.12.M ne kuhquttumooonk nashpe ukkuhkoowaonk Christ woh nagwutteohteau ut Ummoeuwehkomunganit no pajeh wohkukquoshik muttaok.

29.21.E The outward Element to be used in this Ordinance is Water, wherewith the party is to be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, by a Minister of the Gospel lawfully called thereunto.
29.21.M Nippe woskecheyeue teagweyeuooonganuoo ne woh auwahteamuk yeu ut Sacramentseongane kuhquttumooonk uttiyeu nashpe howane mos kutchessumomuk ut oowesuonganit Wutooshimau, kah Wunnaumoniin, kah wunneetupanatamwe Nashauanit nashpe Wunnaunchemookae Nohtompeantog na ut wunnegenue naumatue wehkomumuk.

29.31.E Dipping of the person into the water is not necessary, but Baptism is rightly administred by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person.
29.31.M Mat quenauhikkoooo puogkinnonate howan en nippe, qut Kutchessumooonk sampwi usseen nashpe quowunnumauonate, kah seahhamauonate howan nashpe nippe.

29.41.E Not only those that doe actually profess Faith in, and Obedience unto Christ, but also the Infants of one or both believing parents are to be baptized, and those only.
29.41.M Matta yeug webe usseae sampooacheg Wunnamptauonate kah noswehtauonate Christ, qut onch Ummukiesumoouh pasuk, asuh naneesu wunnamptamooe wutchetonganog woh kutchessumooog, kah yeug webe.

29.51.E Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this Ordinance, yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed to it, as that no person can be regenerated or saved without it; or that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.
29.51.M Tohkonogque ne missi matcheseonk jishshantamunate kah mishanantamunate yeu kitchessumooe kuhquttumooonk, qut onch monanumaonk kah wadchanittuonk matta neane matta chippinnooe kishpisseog yeu kutchessummooe kuhquttumooonk; onk matta howan, matta woh nompe neetu auh wadchanau netohut; qut mat chanantamwe nawhutche nompe neetuog mat mo kutchessumitcheeg.

29.61.E The efficacy of Baptism is not tyed to that moment of time wherein it is administred, yet notwithstanding, by the right use of this Ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the holy Ghost to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of Gods own will in his appointed time.
29.61.M Kutchessumooe menuhkesuonk matta kishpissinoo ne teanuk ahquompi uttiyeu ut anakausue usseen, qut onch monanittuonk ne quoshaumit, matta webe quoshwunnumauut, qut onch wunnamuhkuttee nahtinnit, & enninnumauut nashpe wunneetupanatamwe Nashauanit yeug (asuh wosketompaog asuh mukkiesog) uttiyeug ne monanittuonk wutchaiyeumoo neaunak kogkahqutteamooonk Manittooe wuttenantamooonk ut nehenwonche kuhquttumooe ahquompi.

30.0.E {Of the Lords Supper.}
30.0.M {Papaume Lordooe Mishadtuppooonk.}

30.11.E OUR Lord Jesus in the night wherein he was betrayed, instituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood called the Lords Supper, to be observed in his Churches to the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and shewing forth of the sacrifice of himself in his death, the sealing of all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further ingagement in and to all dutyes which they owe unto him, and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.
30.11.M NUllordumun Jesus Christ ne nan nohkog wanassoomit, kuhquttumup Wussacramentseonk Wuhhogkuh kah OOsqheonk hettamuk Lordooe Mishadtuppooonk, ne woh nanawehteauun ut Ummoeuwehkomunganash no pajeh wohkukquoshik muttaok, wutche nagwutteae mehquanumaonk, kah nahtehteaonk wussephausuonk wuhhogkuh ut wunnuppooonganit, wutch menuhketeauuonk wame oonaiyeuonganash wunnamuhkuttee wunnamptoggeeg, wutch wunnashauanittue assamaonganoo kah wutonchekooononaout kah onkoue ukkishpissuonganoo wunnoswehtauonaout ut wame Manittoowompae usseongash, kah wutch kishpissuonk kah kenohtohsuonk oowetomonaout kah ooweechaiyeutinnaout.

30.21.E In this Sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real Sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or dead, but only a me+morial of that one offering up of himself upon the Cross once for all, and a spiritual Oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same; 
30.21.M Yeuut Sacramentseonk Christ matta sephausu en OOshut, & matta tohhen aiyimmoomuk nishnoh wunnamuhkuttee sephausuonk wutche ahquontausuonk matcheseonk asuh pomantoggeeg asuh napukkeeg: Qut webe mehquanumaonk ne pasukqut sephausuonk nehenwonche nagum ut pummetunka[p]unneganit pasukqut wutch wame; kah nashauanittue Magooonk wame woh ennih waenomaonk en Godut wutche yeu nan: 

30.22.E so that the Popish Sacrifice of the Mass (as they call it) is most abominable injurious to Christs own only Sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of the Elect.

30.31.E The Lord Jesus hath in this Ordinance appointed his Ministers to declare his word of Institution to the People, to pray and bless the Elements of Bread and Wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to an holy use, and to take and break the Bread, to take the Cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the Communicants, but to none who are not then present in the Congregation.
30.31.M Lord Jesus keihtimauop Wunnohtompeantoggeh yeuut Kuhkoowaonk wahteauwahuwonate Ukkuhkoowae wuttinnoowaonk Missinninnuhtu, peantamunate, kah wunnanatamunate woskecheyeue wutteagueyeuooonk Petukqunneg kah Wine, kah yeu nashpe wutchippinnumauonate wutche nanwe en wunnetupanatamwe auwahteaonk, neemunumunate, kah soohqunnumunate Petukqunneg, neemunumunnate Wuttattamwaitch, (nehenwonche nagumau neemunukeeg) kah naneeswe magunate moosogquehtogeeg, qut matta onkatogeeg mat yeuyeu apookeeg ut Mukkinneonganit.

30.41.E Private Masses, or receiving the Sacrament by a Priest, or any other alone, as likewise the denial of the Cup to the People, worshipping the Elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and the reserving them for any pretended religious use, are all contrary to the nature of this Sacrament, and to the Institution of Christ.
30.41.M Kemeyeue Masses (neane hettamunash nashpe Papistuog) asuh attumunumunate Sacramentseonk nashpe Antechristue Sephausuaenin, asuh nishnoh wonkatog nehtaue; asuh quenoowonate Petukqunneg kah Wine, asuh waapenonaout nanawunnonaout wutche nishnoh woskeche nogqussue Manittoowompae auwahteaonk penoowomaiyeuash wuttinnepomantomooonganit yeu Sacramentseonk, kah Christue Ukkuhkoowaonk.

30.51.E The outward Elements in this Sacrament duely set apart to the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet Sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the Body and Blood of Christ; 
30.51.M Woskeche Wutteagueyeuooongash yeuut Sacramentseonk sampwi chippinumunash en yeush auwahteaongash kuhquttukupash nashpe Christ, tatuppeyeue nauwuttamooooash pumnetunkapunnauomukup, onk wunnamuhkuttee qut webe Sacramentsue momanch hettamunash nashpe oowesuonk yeush teanteaguassinish nish anauwuttamookkish, (missahhamunash) Muhhog kah OOsqheonk Christ;

30.61.E That Doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of Bread and Wine into the substance of Christs Body and Blood (commonly called Transubstantiation) by consecration of a Priest, or by any other way, is repugnant not to the Scripture alone, but even to common sense and reason overthroweth the nature of the Sacrament and hath been, and is the cause of manifold Superstitions, yea of gross Idolatries.

30.71.E Worthy Receivers outwardly partaking of the visible Elements in this Sacrament, doe then also inwardly by Faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death;

30.72.E the Body and Blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally in, with, or under the Bread and Wine, yet as really, but spiritually present to the Faith of Believers in that Ordinance, as the Elements themselves are to their outward senses.

30.81.E All ignorant and ungodly persons, as they are unfit to enjoy communion with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lords Table, and cannot without great sin against him, whilst they remain such, partake of these holy Mysteryes, or be admitted thereunto;

31.11.E THE Bodies of men after death return to dust and see corruption, but their souls (which neither dye nor sleep) having an immortal subsistence, immediately return to God who gave them, the souls of the righteous being then made perfect in holiness, are received into the highest heavens, where they behold the face of God in light and glory, waiting for the full redemption of their bodies:

31.32.E the bodies of the just by his Spirit unto honour, and be made conformable to his own glorious Body.
31.32.E Wuhhogkaoash sampwesecheg nashpe Wunnashauanittoomoh pish omohkinoog en quehtianittuonganit kah tatuppeyeueheoog nehenwonche sohsumooe wuhhogkat.

32.0.E {Of the Last Judgement.}
32.0.M {Papaume Mamauchish Wussittumooonk.}

32.11.E GOD hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the World in righteohsness by Jesus Christ, to whom all power and Judgement is given of the Father; 
32.11.M GOD kuhquttum kesukod uttiyeu ut pish wussittum Muttaok ut sampweseonganit nashpe Jesus Christ, noh wame Menuhkesuonk kah Wussittumooonk maguk nashpe Wutooshimau;

32.12.E in which day, not only the Apostate Angels shall be judged, but likewise all persons that have lived upon earth, shall appear before the Tribunal of Christ to give an account of their thoughts, words and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.
32.12.M uttiyeu ut kesukod matta webe Matcheseae Angelsog pish wussumoog, qut onch wame wosketompaog mahche pomantoggeg ut ohkeit pish nepauog anaquabit wussittumooe Appuonganit Christ wunnompagunumunate papaume wuttenantamooonganoooash, ukkuttooonganoooash, kah wuttusseonganoooash, kah attumunumunate neaunak ne asehettit muhhogkat asuh wanegik asuh machuk.

32.21.E The end of Gods appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the glory of his mercy in the eternal salvation of the Elect, and of his Justice in the damnation of the Reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient:
32.21.M God kuhquttum yeu Kesukod webe wutche wahteauwahuonate wussohsumooe moneteaonk ut micheme wadchanittuonganit Pepenauitcheg, kah wutch wahteauwahuwonat wussampweusseonk ut awakompanaonganit Pogkenitcheg, nag matchetukkeeg kah mat noswehtamoogeeg:

32.22.E for then shall the righteous go into everlasting Life, and receive that fulness of joy and glory, with everlasting reward in the presence of the Lord,
32.22.M newaj neit sampwesecheeg pish auog en micheme Pomantamooonganit, kah attumunummunat numwohtae wekontamooonk kah sohsumooonk kah micheme wutonkquatonk ut anaquabit Lord;

32.23.E but the wicked who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.
32.23.M Qut matchetukkeeg mat waheongeeg God, kah mat noswehtamoogeeg oonaunchemookaonk Jesus Christ pish nuhkonog en micheme onkapunaongash, kah pish sasamatahwhoog nashpe michemohtag awakompanaonk wutche anaquabit Lord, kah wussosumooe Menuhkesuonganit.

32.31.E As Christ would have us to be certainly perswaded that there shall be a Judgement, both to deter all men from sin, and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity;
32.3.1.Neane Christ kod nupweshanau woṣketompaog wunnamptamunat OOsittumooonk pish ennih wabesuaheonaout matchesenate, kah wutche anue wekontamwahettuonk wunneetupanatoggeeg ut wutonkapunaonganoooash;

32.32.E so will he have that day unknown to men, that they may shake of all carnal security, and be alwayes watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come,
32.32.M Tatuppeyeue matta oowahteauwahuwoun yeu kesukod woṣketompahtu, onk woh pappauwuhteaog weyausue anwohsinnooonk, kah woh nagwutteae aṣkuhwheteaog, newaj matta wahteauooog uttiyeu hour Lord pish peyau; 

32.41.E and may be ever prepared to say Come Lord Jesus, come quickly. Amen.
32.41.M kah woh nagwutteae quaquashweeog noowonatye Peyaush Lord Jesus, teanuk Peyaush. Amen.

32.51.E The END.
32.51.M Wohkukquoshin.
