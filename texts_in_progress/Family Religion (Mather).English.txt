0.0 {Family Religion}
0.1 Excited, and Assisted.
0.2 By Doctor COTTON MATTHER.
I.0 Some {Reasonable Considerations}, Propounded unto the {Reason} and Conscience of the {Prayerless Housholder}.
I.1.1 INasmuch as all Men are Commanded to {Acknowledge God in all their Wayes}, Surely every {Religious Society} doth owe {Religious Acknowledgments} unto God: 
I.1.2 And it is a very great Wickedness for people in a formed {Society}, to neglect or refuse to express their dependance on the Blessed God for his Blessings.
I.1.3 Now is not a {Family} the very {First Society}, that by the Direction and Providence of God is produced among the Children of Men?
I.1.4 And for such a {Society} never to unite in any {Acts of Piety}, is it not a most unnatural {Profanity} and {Impiety}?
I.2.1 The very {Light of Nature} doth teach us, That {Families} should glorify God with some {Family Worship}.
I.2.2 And really, a {Family} that lives without the Worship of God, doth as it were, {in works deny}, that the {Family} has anything to do with {God}; 
I.2.3 Yea, they seem to disown that God is concerned in the {Making}, and {Keeping}, and {Feeding} of the {Family}. And Oh! how dreadful is it, if any under the {Light of the Gospel} should be guilty of such Prodigious {Atheism}!
I.3.1 The {Light of Scripture} doth expressly inform us of our Duty in this matter.
I.3.2 Is it not expresly required in Ephes. 6.18. {Pray with all Prayer}?
I.3.3 Surely, {Family Prayer} is one sort of Prayer.
I.3.4 Is it not expresly required in I Pet 3 7?
I.3.5 That {Husbands do so dwell with their Wives as that their Prayers be not hindred}; Surely then they are to {Pray with one another}.
I.3.6 Is not not required of {Masters}, Col. 4. 1, 2, 3. {To Pray with their Servants}, yea, {to continue in Prayer with them}? In allusion to the {Continual Offering} under the Law, which was presented both {Morning} and {Evening} before the Lord.
I.3.7 The {Scriptures} do tell us, That those {Families} are the {Workers of Iniquity} which {Call not upon God}.
I.3.8 And indeed they may well be called so, because they do by their Practice declare, That they {Owe nothing to God}, That they do not {Want}, and that they have not {Had} any Mercies from the Lord.
I.3.9 The {Scriptures} do tell us, that if {Grace} be in the {Heart}, there will be {Prayer} in the {House}. Acts 10. 1. 2.
I.3.10 That Man that {Fears God}, will show it by {Praying to God with his House}.
I.3.11 If there be no Prayer to God in the House, may it not be said, {Surely the Fear of God is not in this Place}?
I.4.1 Have we no {Family Sins} to be Pardoned? No {Family Wants} to be Supplyed? No {Family Griefs} to be Relieved? No {Family Fears} to be Prevented? No good things in our {Families} to be {Thankful} for? No {Family Concerments} to be commended until the Smiles of Heaven?
I.4.2 Are not {Family Prayers} loudly demanded by such {Family Cases}?
I.4.3 O! If {Conscience} could be heard, would it not speak thus much? That a Family {without Prayer}, is a Family {without God}, and {without Christ}, and so {without Hope} of Escaping the Curses of Heaven.
I.5.1 Do not the {Souls} of our Children cry unto us, to Pray {with} them, as well as {for} them?
I.5.2 Is it likely they will ever {Pray}, until we {Teach} them to Pray? If they {Die Prayerless}, must they not Perish under the dreadfull wrath of God? And how shall we answer for our {Prayerless Cruelty} towards them?
1.6.1 Are not {Prayerless Families} the great Nurseries of {Ignorance} and {Wickedness} in the World? The {Nests} that produce Serpents; The {Dens} that will probably nourish very Dragons of Malignity against the ways of God. O who will venture to put out a Son or Daughter to live in such a Family?
1.7.1 You that are {Housekeepers} must not be {Ashamed} to Pray to God with your Family, for Christ Jesus has said, Mark 8. 38. {Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me, and of My Words, I will be ashamed of him.}
1.7.2 If you would not be {Ashamed} for ever, you must have {Respect unto all the Commandments of God}, now {Family Prayer} is one of the things commanded by God, and you should be {Ashamed} to live in the neglect of it.
1.8.1 You must not have the Face to pretend that you {have no Time} for {Family Prayer}, for you have {Time} for things of a less concernment every day, and indeed every other {Work of the Day} would prosper the better for Mens abounding in this {Work of the Lord}.
1.8.2 No Man was ever the {Poorer}, because he twice every Day would call his Folks to join with him in seeking to the God whose {Blessing maketh Rich}.
1.9.1 You must not plead that you want {Ability, Capacity, Expression} to discharge the duty of {Praying} with your Family, for you know, you can express your self when you go to a Neighbour for {Help} when any Distress is upon you.
1.9.2 Oh! If you did seriously consider the condition of your own {Souls}, and in what a condition the Perishing {Souls} of your Family are in, you would not be at a loss to know what are the {Desires} that you should spread before the Lord.
I.9.3 It is not the {Multitude} nor the {Fineness} of words in Prayer that makes it acceptable unto God.
1.9.4 Though you may be one of mean Capacity, yet if you will be prevail'd withal to try, and call your {Families} together, and {Begin to Pray} before them, it may be upon Trial, you will find the Lord enabling you to your Duty, even beyond your expectation.
1.10.1 To be sure, no Man when he comes to {Die} will repent of his Praying to God with his Family. If you ask any Man in his {Dying Hours} whether it be adviseable to keep {Family Prayer} alive, for certain he will by all means advise to it.
I.10.2 Surely then it is great Wisdom for Men to {do now}, as they will when they come to Die wish they {had done}.
I.11.1 Suppose all the {Friends} we have on Earth should utterly disown us, and reject us, if we did not {Pray} in our Families; Would we not then set upon the Practice of it? But is not the {God of Heaven} Infinitely more than all then {Friends on Earth}, and has not the Infinite God threatned us, that if our {Families do not call upon His Name}, He will never own us for His, but {Pour out his great Wrath} upon us?
I.11.2 Suppose we were to be turned out of our {Houses}, if we did not {Pray} with our Families, would we not then take up this practice? But has not the Holy God resolved, that He will {shut us out of Heaven}, if we do not Pray with our Families? And Oh! that {House which is not made with Hands}, is of inconceivably more value than our {Earthly Houses}.
I.11.3 Suppose you were to pay a {Fine} of {Ten Shillings}, every time you don't Pray with our Families, would you not then lay aside all Objections, and presently set upon Duty? And is not the {Anger of God} more dreadful than a {Fine} of {Ten Shillings}? And is not {Family Prayer} necessary to deliver a Family from the Formidable {Anger of God}>
I.11.4 Suppose you were Faithfully promised {Ten Pounds}, or {Ten Shillings} every time you Pray with your Fmailies, would you not {then} soon overcome all Difficulties and Objections, & attend your Duty without any Delay? But is not the {Blessing of God}, which may be obtained by Family Prayer, more considerable than a reward of {Ten Pounds}, or {Ten Shillings}? Or has our God said unto us, {that we should seek his Face in vain}.
I.12.1 {Daniel} was to {Die} for it, if he did Pray {and some think it was with his {Family}} were we to be Punished with {Death} for {not Praying} with our Families would we not then do it immediately? But is not the {Prayerless Housholder} who {Knows} the Will of God, but refuses to do it, in danger of {Eternal Death, Wrath} and {Misery}.
I.13.1 When a {Morning} arrives, what if we knew, that it were the {last Morning} that ever we shall see with our Families? Would we not then {Pray} with them? When a {Night} comes, if we knew it were the {last Night} that ever we should have with our Families? Would we not then {Pray} with them? Now no man living knows any other than that it may be {the Last}.
I.16.1 How can those {Wives} answer it unto God, who do not use their utmost Endeavours to perswade and oblige their {Husbands} to maintain Prayer in their Families:
I.17.1 In a Family where {Good Orders} are kept, and Prayer is every Morning & Evening Seriously carried on, the {Children} are likely to be more {Orderly}, more {Dutiful}, more {Virtuous}, than in a Family where God is not sought unto; and {Religious Families} are great Blessings in the Common-wealth.
I.18.1 True {Christians of all Sorts} will say, that constant {Family Worship} is so necessary to keep alive a Sense of God, and Religion in the Minds of Men, that it cannot justly be supposed, That any {Family} that continues to neglect it, can in Reason be Esteemed a {Family of Christians}; or indeed to have any Religion at all. O think of these Things and be convinced, that it is your {Duty to Pray with your Families}; and I will shew you how so to do.
II.0 Some short and plain {Directions} for your Assistance in the Performacne of the great Duty of {Family Prayer}.
II.1.1 In the first Place, Look up to the Great God for His {Holy Spirit}, which He has promised to them that ask Him, to {Help their Infirmities} in calling upon His Holy Name.
II.2.1 Improve the {Holy Scriptures} to Help you in this Mater. Persons of the most ordinary Capacity may soon Learn to turn a great Part of the {Scriptures} into {Prayers}: And the {Scriptures} are in part given to us for this very End, that we may from thence Compose our {Prayers}.
II.2.2 Many of the {Psalms} are plainly Calculated for this purpose, and it is very Easy, and very Lawful to take a Suitable {Psalm}, or part of one, and with a very little Alteration to turn it into a very good {Prayer}.
II.2.3 As now for Instance; Take the {first Psalm} and Pray, {Lord make us the Blessed Ones, who walk not in the Counsel of the Ungodly, nor stand in the way of Sinners, but let our Delight be in the Law of the Lord}.
II.2.4 Certainly, a {Repenting Sinner} would find it no Difficulty to make a Prayer out of the {Fifty first Psalm}, or the {Hundred and Thirtieth}.
II.2.5 Certainly, a {Sorrowful Christian} can as easily do so by the {Hundred and Forty Second Psalm}, or the {Hundred and Forty Third}.
II.2.6 It is your Duty, Sirs, to {Search the Scriptures}, and for that End you should attentively {Read} them in your Families when you are going to {Prayer}, and so first hear {God speaking to us}, in order to our {speaking with God}.
II.2.7 We should Read the {Word of Christ} in our {Dwellings}, that it may {Dwell Richly with us}: And one Intention in our Searching the Scriptures, may be to fetch from thence the {Prayers} that you are to spread before the Lord.
II.3.1 When you have heard a good {Sermon}, Seriously Consider, {with what further Matter of Request and Prayer you should now go before the Lord}. Ask your selves, what further {Favour of God}, you have been put in Mind by a good {Sermon} to ask for. Hereby in a little time you may with God's Blessing, obtain not only the {Gift}, but the {Grace} of Prayer.
II.4.1 Persons of the most ordinary Capacity may easily turn what they meet with in the {Catechisms} into {Prayers}.
II.4.2 That {Catechism} which Teacheth us, {Who is our Maker}, &c., may Learn us to Bless the God that {Made us, Keeps us, and can Save us}, and to confess the {Corrupt Nature} we brought into the World with us, and to ask for the {Grace} that may Change our Nature, to Confess our Sins against the {Commands of God}, and to ask that we may be {Saved} by the Lord Jesus Christ, from the {Death} and {Damnation that is the Wages of our Sins.}
II.4.3 That {Catechism} which tells us, {What is the Chief End of Man}, Teaches us to Pray for {Grace} to do that which is our {Chief End}; and for {Grace} to Embrace and follow the {Rule} which God has therefore given us. When it tells us, {What God is}, it Teacheth us to ask for Grace to Own Him, and Serve Him as such. When it tells us the Condition of {Sinfulness} and {Wretchedness} into which our Fall from God has brought us; It Teacheth us to {Pray for Deliverance} from that Condition.
II.4.4 When it tells us the {Offices} of {Jesus Christ}, it Teaches us to {Pray}, That these Offices may be {Executed} for us.
II.4.5 When it tells us the {Benefits} of {Jesus Christ}, it Teaches us to {Pray}, That we may be made Partakers of these {Benefits}.
II.4.6 When it tells us, what is {Forbidden} in the {Commandments}, it Teaches us to {Pray} for the {Pardon of our Sins} against the Commandments.
II.4.7 When it tells us what is {Required} in the {Commandments}, it Teaches us to Pray for {Help to do} what is Required.
II.4.8 When it Describes unto us the {Graces} of a Regenerate Christian, it Teaches us to Pray for those {Graces}.
II.4.9 Finally, When it Expounds the {Lords Prayer}, it Supplies us with {Materials} for {our Prayers} unto the Lord.
II.5.1 I will Offer one Direction more, and that is this:
II.5.2 When you are going to Pray with your {Family}, Think with your self, {It may be this is the last Prayer that ever I shall make with my Family}! And can you then find nothing to say on the behalf of thine own Soul, and of thy Family? Certainly, the Agony of this Consideration would so on cause thee to think of some Fervent Cries unto God; Such as these:
II.5.3 {O Glorious God, we know Thou canst do every thing, and Thou art Rich in Mercy; We are Sinners, we are the Chief of Sinners, but Jesus Christ came into the World that He might Save the Chief of Sinners. O give us a saving Interest in Jesus Christ, let our Sins be Pardoned for the sake of Him, who Saves His People from their Sins}
II.5.4 {Give new Hearts unto us; Give us Hearts to Fear Thee, Love Thee, Serve Thee. Let our Souls be all Bound up in the Bundle of Life.}
II.5.5 {We beseech Thee, O Lord, to Deliver our Souls. Guide us by Thy Counsel, and bring us to Glory. Be Merciful to us for the Sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.}
II.5.6 Many, many more such Petitions would soon be Dictated by the Distress of a Mind, apprehending the near approach of Death, and {after Death the Judgment}.
II.5.7 To Conclude; for the further Assistance of such {Housholders}, who in Sence of their Incapacity make the Request once made by the Disciples of our Saviour, {Teach us to Pray}; I shall Offer some Select Scriptural Passages, wherein our Saviour has Taught us to Pray: Confessions and Petitions in the Express words of the {Sacred Scriptures}, which are some of the many that a Family may spread before the Lord.
II.5.8 {Thou O God, even Thou art God alone; Thou hast Created all things, and Thou Preservest them all, and the Host of Heaven Worshippeth Thee. Great is our Lord, and of great Power, His Understanding is Infinite.}
II.5.9 {The Lord is Righteous in all His Wayes, and Holy in all His Works.}
II.5.10 {The Lord is also Good unto all, and His tender Mercies are over all His Works.}
II.5.11 {Thou art Plenteous in Mercy unto all them that call upon Thee. Give Ear, O Lord, unto our Prayer, and attend to the Voice of our Supplications.}
II.5.12 {By one Man} (even by our first Father) {Sin has Entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and so Death has passed upon all Men, for that all have Sinned; and now in many things we Offend all. If Thou Lord shouldest mark Iniquity, O Lord, who should stand? But there is Forgiveness with Thee, that Thou mayest be Feared.}
II.5.13 {God so Loved the World, as to give His only begotten Son, that whosoever Believeth in Him, should not Perish, but have Everlasting Life. Lord,} we desire to {Believe, help Thou our Unbelief. Let the Blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God, Cleanse us from all Sin. Order our steps in thy Word, and let not any Iniquity have Dominion over us. Let the God of Peace Sanctify us throughout, and preserve our whole Spirit, Soul and Body blameless, unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.}
II.5.14 {Over all the Enemies of our Salvation, let us be more than Conquerers through Him that has Loved us. Let the Goodness of God lead us to Repentance, and let our Chastisement be for our Benefit, even that we may be Partakers of His Holiness.}
II.5.15 Lord, {Guide us by Thy Counsel, and after receive us to Glory. Feed us with Food convenient for us.}
II.5.16 {O Bless us indeed; let thine Hand be with us; keep us from Evil, that it may not greive us.}
II.5.17 {Do Good, O Lord, unto those that be Good; Save Thy People, Bless thine Inheritance; Feed them also, and lift them up for ever.}
II.5.18 {Let thy Way be known upon the Earth, and thy Salvation among all Nations. Let there be no Complaining in our Streets, and let us be the Happy People, whose God is the Lord.}
II.5.19 We are to make {Supplication for those in Authority over us, that we may lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives in all Godliness and Honesty.}
II.5.20 Let the Lord {Execute Judgment for the Oppressed, and give Food to the Hungry, and loose the Prisoners.}
II.5.21 {Let the Lord raise them that are bowed down, and relieve the Orphan, and the Widow, and overthrow th way of the Wicked.}
II.5.22 {We Bless the Lord with our Souls for all His Benefits,} who {Forgives our Iniquities,} who {Relieves our Infirmities}, who {Redeems our Lives from Destruction}, and {Crowns us with Loving Kindness and Tender Mercies.}
II.5.23 {Thus would we shew forth the Favour of God in the Morning, and His Faithfulness every Night.}
II.5.24 {Let us be Accepted in the Beloved Son of God, who ever Lives to make Intercession for us.}
II.5.25 The Good Man's Resolution,
II.5.26 {As for me and mine House, we will Serve the Lord.}
