3.E I. Some {Reasonable Considerations}, Propounded unto the {Reason} and Conscience of the {Prayerless Housholder}.

4.μ 1. Nean Wame Wosketompaog Annoonut Sampoowaonon God ut Wame ummayeuwout ^Prov: 3.6^ wunnamuhkut nishnoh wechiyeutue teass[oo]o[oo]nk Unnohhukquahwhussuog peantamoe Sampoowaonaongash God: Josh. 24:5
4.E 1. Inasmuch as all Men are Commanded to {Acknowledge God in all their Wayes}, Surely every {Religious Society} doth owe Religious Acknowledgments unto God:

5.μ Kah ne ahche missi matchetooonk wutche Missinninnuog ayitcheg ut kuhkinneassue wechiyeutuonganit mukkoonaumunat asuh Chekunumunat mussohhamun wuttompattissinoonnaonganoo wunnanitteae Godoh wutche ummonanteaongash
5.E And it is a very great wickedness for People in a formed {Society}, to neglect or refuse to express their dependance on the Blessed God for his Blessings.

6.μ Eyeu Sunnummatta teashshinninneonk ne nahnaneyeue negonne teassooooonk uttuh nashpe ukkuhko[o]tumwehteaonk & Wuttinnanitteaon[k] God paomoouk kenugke Wunnô[mo]n[ñ]auh wosketompaog
6.E Now is not a {Family} the very {First Society}, that by the Direction and Providence of God is produced among the Children of Men?

7.μ Kah wutche ne ahunnag teassooooonk matta nanukqut mosogqueunat en teagwe manitooe Uss[e]onganit ne ahche puppinnasshimwe tohnoocheyeuooonk & matchetooonk
7.E And for such a {Society} never to unite in any {Acts of Piety}, is it not a most unnatural {Profanity} and {Impiety}?

8.μ 2. Unnuppomantamooongane Wequai ne kukkuhkootumongqunan teashshinninneongash woh Sohsumooonao[g] Godoh nashpe ne teagwe teahshinneongane wauwussummuaonk
8.E 2. The very {Light of Nature} doth teach us, That {Families} should glorify God with some {Family Worship}.

9.μ Kah wunnamuhkut teashshinninneonk matta adtanuppomantamo[o]munook ut wauwussumaonganit God yaneyeu ut anakausuonganit quanoowamuk ne teasshinninneonk ne teag wuttissetunkqunnat God nux nag ogqunneunkqussuog mat sampooomuk God oowetshaonk ut kezheaonk & nanauwehtooonk & Sohkomootoonk ne teashshinnineonk & woi toh en u[h]kqueneunkquad, tohneit howan agwe wunnonchemookae wequai kessuhkouttug ne ahunnag unkqueneunkque Matchetoowaenuooonk: Rom. 1. 21, 22, 25, 28, 29, 30.
9.E And really, a {Family} that lives without the Worship of God, doth as it were, {in works deny}, that the {Family} has anything to do with {God}; Yea, they seem to disown that God is concerned in the {Making}, and {Keeping}, and {Feeding} of the {Family}. And Oh! How dreadful is it, if any under the {Light of the Gospel} should be guilty of such prodigious {Atheism}!

10.μ 3. Oowequaiyeum Wussuhquohhosuongash ne piuh[s]uhke noowotumonkquinnan nunnooswetamooonganun yeu ut
10.E 3. The {Light of Scripture} doth expresly inform us of our Duty in this matter.

11.μ Sunnummatta piuhsuhke nattauompattamooun. Eph. 6. 18. {Naguwutteae Peantamook nashpe wame Peantamooonk}.
11.E Is it not expresly required in Ephes. 6. 18. {Pray with all Prayer}?

12.μ Pogkodche teashshinninnêongane peantamoonk ne pasuk assoowetamuk Peantamooonk
12.E Surely, {Family Prayer} is one sort of Prayer.

13.μ Sunnummatta piuhsuhke nattauompattamooun. 1 Pet. 3. 7.
13.E Is it not expresly required in 1 Pet 3. 7 ?

14.μ onk woh wasukkiinneunk ne unne wetomăhittich ummittumwussoouk onk woh Uppeantamoooonganoowoash matta wuttamehteooounat neit wunnamuhkut nag woh weche peantam8tuog.
14.E That {Husbands do so dwell with their Wives as that their Prayers be not hindred}; Surely then they are to {Pray with one another}.

15.μ Sunnummatta nattauompattamauounna Wussontimominneunk. Col. 4. 1, 2, 3. peantamunat wutche wuttinninnumoouh nux nagwutteanumun[à]t Peantamooonk wutche nag neaneyeuŭkup nagwutteae Sephausuonk ut agwe naumatuonganit uttuh yeu magumukup naneeswe mohtompanae & wunnonkquae anaquabit Lord.
15.E Is it not required of {Masters}, Col. 4.1,2,3. {To Pray with their Servants}, yea, {to continue in Prayer with them}? In allusion to the {Continual Offering} under the Law, which was presented both {Morning} and {Evening} before the Lord.

16.μ Wussuhquohwhosuongash nuttukquinnanonash teashshinninneongash matcheseae, anakausitcheg uttuh matta wehuttumauongik Godoh
16.E The {Scriptures} do tell us, That those {Families} are the {Workers of Iniquity} which {Call not upon God}.

17.μ & Wunnamuhkut ne woh wunne henn8na newutche nag nashpe wuttehhisseongann8 wahteauwahuwaog nag matta teag unnohtukquohhukooog God nag matta quenauehhikooog & nag asq nequt attumunumooog  ne teagwe monanteaongash wutch Lordut.
17.E And indeed they may well be called so, because they do by their Practice declare, That they Owe nothing to God, that they do not Want, and that they have not Had any Mercies from the Lord.

18.μ Wussukwhongash nuttukquinnanonash tohneit kuttumonteanittuonk ohtak ut Metahhut na pish peantamooongannu8oo ut wetuomut Act. 10. 1, 2.
18.E The Scriptures do tell us, that if Grace be in the Heart, there will be Prayer in the House. Acts 10. 1. 2.

19.μ Noh Wosketomp quoshont Godoh nont wunn[a]htĕhkon nashpe uppeantamauaonk God wutche week
19.E That Man that Fears God, will show it by Praying to God with his House.

20.μ Tohneit matta peantamauaonganunook God ut Wetuomut Sunnummatta woh unn8waun wunnamuhkut qushaonk God matta ohtan8 ut yeu Aiyeuonganit & teagua God usset en ne onsitcheg: Jer. 10:25.
20.E If there be no Prayer to God in the House, may it not be said, Surely the Fear of God is not in this Place?

21.E 4. Have we no {Family Sins} to be Pardoned? No {Family Wants} to be Supplyed? No {Family Griefs} to be Relieved? No {Family Fears} to be Prevented? No good things in our Families to be Thankful for? No {Family Concernments} to be commended unto the Smiles of Heaven?

22.μ Sunnummatta teashinninneongane Peantamoongash mishontowae wehquttumunash nashpe nish teashshininneongane Unniyeuongash. [X. nukkuhkootumongqunan: Matt 6. 9.]
22.E Are not {Family Prayers} loudly demanded by such {Family Cases}?

23.E O! If {Conscience} could be heard, would it not speak thus much? That a {Family without Prayer}, is a {Family without God}, and {without Christ}, and so {without Hope} of Escaping the Curses of Heaven.

24.μ 5. Sunnummatta ukketeahogkônoouh Nunnechanunnonog nummauinittunkoounonog weche peantamoomonat neane peantamwanshonat?
24.E 5. Do not the {Souls of our Children} cry unto us, to {Pray with them}, as well as {for them}?

25.E Is it likely that they will ever Pray, until we Teach them to Pray? If they Die Prayerless, must they not Perish under the dreadfull wrath of God? And how shall we answer for our Prayerless Cruelty towards them?

26.μ 6. Sunnummatta teashinninneongash mat peantamomunoogish mishe sohkomootooomoouk Assootuonk & Matcheetooonk ut Muttaohkeit. Wadishash uttuh pattooomoouk Ashkookog.

26.E 6. Are not {Prayerless Families} the great Nurseries of {Ignorance} and {Wickedness} in the World? The Nests that produce Serpents; The Dens that will probably nourish very Dragons of Malignity against the ways of God. O who will venture to put out a Son or Daughter to live in such a Family?

27.μ 7. Kenau Wekittamooenue[a]gish ahque odkodchooteag peantamauonat God ut kutteashinninneonganooout newutche Christ Jesus unn8wop. Mark 8. 38. Howan ogkodchoowesit & nuttinn8waongash, pish nānuk nutogkodch8waon
27.E 7. You that are {Housekeepers} must not be {Ashamed} to Pray to God with your Family, for Christ Jesus has said, Mark 8. 38. {Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me, and of My Words, I will be ashamed of him}.

28.μ tohneit kod aogkodchooog micheme moohche mos k8toow[a]ntam wame wuttann8teamooongash God neit teashshinninneongane peantamooonk ne pasuk quinnuuk annoohteamumuk nashpe God & woh kutogkodchumwo adt pomantamagish mukkoonaumooonganit ne
28.E If you would not be {Ashamed} for ever, you must have {Respect unto all the Commandments of God}, now {Family Prayer} is one of the things commanded by God, and you should be {Ashamed} to live in the neglect of it.

29.μ 8.

29.E 8. You must not have the Face to pretend that you have {no Time} for {Family Prayer}, for you have Time for things of a less concernment every day, and indeed every other Work of the Day would prosper the better for Mens abounding in this {Work of the Lord}.

30.μ Wosketomp asq nequt k8tatchetooh wutche neesit nompe nishnoh kesukodut Oowehkumaonk ummissinninnumog ummosogquehtunkquinat ut Nattinneohwhaonganit God noh oonanitteaongash weenaueghuomooŭkish
30.E No Man was ever the Poorer, because he twice every Day would call his Folks to join with him in seeking to the God whose {Blessing maketh Rich}.

31.μ 9. Unn8wohkon nukquenauehhik Sapenumooonk Wamequttamooonk nehtôuhquatumooonk Magunat (Ussenat) nooswetamooonk wutche Pantamoomonat nutteashinninneonk newutche koowahteo woh kenehtōuhquatumannooh peyaonat wetatteamonkanin wutche aninnumoadtuonkwuttamehpunnaonk aiyeugqueano
31.E 9. You must not plead that you want {Ability, Capacity, Expression} to discharge the duty of {Praying with your Family}, for you know, you can express your self when you go to a Neighbour for Help when any Distress is upon you.

32.μ Woi Tohneit pahke natwontaman kittumongke wuttinniyeuonk kukketeahogk8 & wuttinniyeuonganoo pagwanue ukketeahogkonoouhkut teashinninnaonk woh matta k8wanhikoo wahteauun teague kodtantam8ongash, nish woh sepagunumun ut anaquabit Lord.
32.E Oh! if you did seriously consider the condition of your own {Souls}, and in what a condition the Perishing {Souls of your Family} are in, you would not be at a loss to know what are the {Desires} that you should spread before the Lord.

33.μ Matta Monagish asuh wunnohteae kuttooongash ut peantamunat waj woh attumunukquohk ut Godut
33.E It is not the {Multitude} nor the {Fineness} of words in Prayer that makes it acceptable unto God.

34.E Though you may be one of mean Capacity, yet if you will be prevail'd withal to try, and call your {Families} together, and {Begin to Pray} before them, it may be upon Trial, you will find the Lord enabling you to your Duty, even beyond your expectation.

35.μ 10.

35.E 10. To be sure, no Man when he comes to {Die} will repent of his {Praying to God with his Family}. If you ask any Man in his {Dying Hours} whether it be adviseable to keep {Family Prayer} alive, for certain he will by all means advise to it.

36.μ Neit pahke unnih, ne mishe waantamoonk wutche wosketompaog Yeuyeu ussenat ne woh ussehhittit ut wunnuppooonganoowout nont weantamwog napehnont nuttaussenas.
36.E Surely then it is great Wisdom for Men to {do now}, as they will when they come to Die wish they {had done}.

37.E 11. Suppose all the {Friends} we have on Earth should utterly disown us, and reject us, if we did not Pray in our Families; Would we not then set upon the Practice of it? But is not the {God of Heaven} Infinitely more than all the {Friends on Earth}, and has not the Infinite God threatened us, that if our Families do not call upon His Name, He will never own us for His, but {Pour out his great Wrath} upon us?

38.μ tohneit woh sohkookauunog wutche nekunnonut mat peantamoog ut nutteashinninneonganunnonut Sunnummatta woh yeu nuttussumun? qut Sunnummatta wunnetupanatamweyeuit God papogkodtantontamup nussohshakkunukqunnanonut wutche kesukqut tohneit mat peantamoog ut nutteashinni[n]neonganunnonash? & Woi ne wetu kezteausik nashpe matta menitchegash ne matta waomuk onkoue mishoadtu onk neit ohke nekunnonash
38.E Suppose we were to be turned out of our {Houses}, if we did not Pray with our Families, would we not then take up this Practice? But has not the {Holy God} resolved, that He will shut us out of {Heaven}, if we do not Pray with our Families? And Oh! That {House which is not made with Hands}, is of inconceivably more value than our {Earthly Houses}.

39.μ Tohneit wussumunumuk oadtehkonat neesompagod nishnoh ahquompi mat peantamooan ut kutteashinninneonganit Sun woh matta kuppa[n]ne ponamooh wame wuttoowaongash, & teanuk kukquenĭttam nooswetamoonk—Act. 5:29.—Sunnummat ummoosquantamooonk God kooche uhqueneunkquattinnooonk neesompagke wussittumooonk? & Sunnummat teasshinninneongane peantamooonk quenauattinnoo pohquohwhuttauunat teashinnineonk wutch ne uhqueneunkqu[e]t ummusquantam8onk God?
39.E Suppose you were to pay a {Fine of Ten Shillings}, every time you don't Pray with your Families, would you not then lay aside all Objections, and presently set upon Duty? And is not the {Anger of God} more dreadful than a {Fine of Ten Shillings}? And is not {Family Prayer} necessary to deliver a Family from the Formidable {Anger of God}?

40.μ Tohneit pahke wunnoowohkanunumuk piog uppoundash asuh neesompogod nishnoh ahquompi paontamanish ut kutteashinninneonganit Sun woh mô kenuppe kuttaneuhkomooh wame siogokish & wuttoowaongash & assuhkomooh kenooswetamoonk nashpe mat pitchunwoeonk?

40.E Suppose you were Faithfully promised {Ten Pounds}, or {Ten Shillings} every time you Pray with your Families, would you not then soon overcome all Difficulties and Objections, & attend your Duty without any Delay? But is not the {Blessing of God}, which may be obtained by {Family Prayer}, more considerable than a reward of {Ten Pounds}, or {Ten Shillings}? Or has our God said unto us, that we should seek His Face in vain.

41.μ 12. Daniel mô ooche woh nuppunnat ne tohneit peantam[o]nt & nawhutche unnantamwo[g] ne ut wutteashinninneongan[it] Danl. 6.11, 16.

Rom 6. 23.
41.E 12. {Daniel} was to Die for it, if he did Pray (and some think it was with his Family) were we to be Punished with Death for not Praying with our Families would we not then do it immediately? But is not the {Prayerless Householder} who {Knows the Will of God}, but refuses to do it, in danger of {Eternal Death, Wrath and Misery}.

42.μ 13. Tohneit nequt mohtompan peyomoouk tohneit wahteauog ne woh momitjisheyeuuk ne woh naumog nashpe nutteashinnineonganunnonash, Sun woh mat nooweche peantamoomononog?

42.E 13. When a {Morning} arrives, what if we knew, that it were the {last Morning} that ever we shall see with our Families? Would we not then Pray with them? When a {Night} comes, if we knew it were the {last Night} that ever we should have with our Families? Would we not then Pray with them? Now no Man living knows any other but that it may be {the Last}.

43.μ 16. Uttuh woh wuttinne nampoohumaunna Godut yeug ummittumwussinneunk matta manehkinnitteahitteg ahchoomonat & pasooonat wasukkoowoh en menukkinumunat peantamooonk ut Wutteashinninneongannoowout 1. Cor: 7.14.
43.E 16. How can those {Wives} answer it unto God, who do not use their utmost Endeavours to perswade and oblige their {Husbands} to maintain Prayer in their Families:

44.μ Ut teashshinninneonganit wanegik kuhkenauwinneunkquokish nanauwehteomuk & peantamooonk nishnoh pohtompan & wunnonkoo maninnissue k[un]ninosik mukkoiog woh kooche kuhkenauinneunkqussuog, kooche nooswetamoog kooche wunnetoog onk neit ut teashshinninneonganit uttuh God adt nattinne[o]hwhout & peantamoe teasshinninneonkash mishe wunnanittuongash kenugke Wetâteotŭog. Prov. 22.6 & 29. 15.
44.E 17. In a {Family} where {Good Orders} are kept, and Prayer is every Morning & Evening Seriously carried on, the {Children} are likely to be more {Orderly}, more {Dutiful}, more {Virtuous}, than in a Family where God is not sought unto; and {Religious Families} are great Blessings in the Common-wealth.

44B.E 18. A Whole Town was Destroyed with an Earthquake Except One house in which the good man was then at Prayer with his family If an Earthquake were to be sent upon this Town & Every family that is without Family Prayer were to be destroyed in the Earthquake should we not then fly to Prayers with our families for our Preservation--And is there not as much cause for Supplications to Prevent of Everlasting Destruction of the Souls in our families.


45.E 18. True {Christians} of all Sorts will say, that constant {Family Worship} is so necessary to keep alive a Sence of God, and Religion in the Minds of Men, that it cannot justly by supposed, that any Family that continues to neglect it, can in Reason be Esteemed a {Family of Christians}; or indeed to have any Religion at all. O think of these Things and be convinced, that it is your Duty to {Pray with your Families}; and I will shew you how so to do.

46.μ 
46.E II. Some short and plain {Directions} for your Assistance in the Performance of the great Duty of {Family Prayer}.

47.μ 
47.E 1. In the first place, Look up to the Great God for His {Holy Spirit}, which He has promised to them that ask Him, to {Help their Infirmities} in calling upon His Holy Name.

48.μ 
48.E 2. Improve the {Holy Scriptures} to Help you in this Matter. Persons of the most ordinary Capacity may soon Learn to turn a great part of the Scriptures into Prayers: And the Scriptures are in part given to us for this very End, that we may from thence Compose our Prayers.

49.μ 
49.E Many of the {Psalms} are plainly Calculated for this purpose, and it is very Easy, and very Lawful to take a Suitable {Psalm}, or part of one, and with a very little Alteration to turn it into a very good Prayer.

50.μ 
50.E As now for Instance: Take the {first Psalm} and Pray, {Lord make us the Blessed Ones, who walk not in the Counsel of the Ungodly, nor stand in the way of Sinners, but let our Delight be in the Law of the Lord}.

51.μ 
51.E Certainly, a {Repenting Sinner} would find it no Difficulty to make a Prayer out of the {Fifty first Psalm}, or the {Hundred and Thirtieth}.

52.μ 
52.E Certainly, a {Sorrowful Christian} can as easily do so by the {Hundred and Forty Second Psalm}, or the {Hundred and Forty Third}.

53.μ 
53.E It is your Duty, Sirs, to {Search the Scriptures}, and for that End you should attentively {Read them in your Families} when you are going to Prayer, and so first hear {God speaking to us}, in order to our {speaking unto God}.

54.μ 
54.E We should {Read the Word of Christ in our Dwellings}, that it may {Dwell Richly with us}: And one Intention in our Searching the Scriptures, may be to fetch from thence the Prayers that you are to spread before the Lord.

55.μ 
55.E 3. When you have heard a {good Sermon}, Seriously Consider, with what further Matter of Request and Prayer you should now go before the Lord. Ask your selves, what further {Favour of God}, you have been put in Mind by a good Sermon to ask for. Hereby in a little time you may with God's Blessing, obtain not only the {Gift}, but the {Grace of Prayer}.

56.μ 
56.E 4. Persons of the most ordinary Capacity may easily turn what they meet with in the {Catechisms} into Prayers.

57.μ 
57.E That {Catechism} which Teacheth us, {Who is our Maker}, &c. may Learn us to Bless the God that {Made us}, {Keeps us}, and {can Save us}, and to confess the {Corrupt Nature} we brought into the World with us, and to ask for the {Grace} that may Change our Nature, to Confess our {Sins against the Commands of God}, and to ask that we may be {Saved by the Lord Jesus Christ}, from the {Death and Damnation} that is the {Wages of our Sins}.

58.μ 
58.E That {Catechism} which tells us, {What is the Chief End of Man}, Teaches us to Pray for {Grace} to do that which is our {Chief End}; and for {Grace} to Embrace and follow the {Rule} which God has therefore given us. When it tells us, {What God is}, it Teacheth us to ask for {Grace} to Own Him, and Serve Him as such. When it tells us the Condition of {Sinfulness and Wretchedness} into which our Fall from God has brought us; It Teacheth us to Pray for {Deliverance} from that Condition.

59.μ 
59.E When it tells us the {Offices of Jesus Christ}, it Teaches us to Pray, That these {Offices} may be {Executed for us}.

60.μ
