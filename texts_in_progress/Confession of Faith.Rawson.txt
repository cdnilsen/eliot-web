1.0.1.E {Of the Holy Scripture.}
1.0.1.M {Papaume Manittooe Wussukwhonganash.}

1.1.1.E ALthough the Light of Nature, and the Works of Creation and Providence, do so far manifest the Goodness, Wisdom and Power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that knowledge of God and of his Will, which is necessary unto Salvation:

1.1.2.E Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in diverse manners to reveal himself, and declare that his Will unto his Church; and afterwards for the better preserving and propagating of the Truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the Church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of Satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly to writing: which maketh the holy Scripture to be most necessary; those former wayes of Gods revealing his will unto his People being now ceased.

1.2.1.E Under the name of holy Scripture, or the Word of God written, are now contained all the Books of the Old and New Testament, which are these:
1.2.1.M Nashpe manittoe wussukwhonganash, noowohtamumun wame Booksash Nukkone kah Wuṣku Testament yeush asuhkommoomoogish.

1.2.6.E All of which are given by the inspiration of God to be the Rule of Faith and life.
1.2.6.M Wame uttiyeush kittinninnummonteananonash nashpe wunnashanittassuonk God wutche Wunnamptamooe, kah pomantamooe Quttuhwheganit.

1.3.1.E The Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of Divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of the Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of, then other humane writings.

1.4.1.E The Authority of the holy Scripture, for which it ought to be believed and obeyed, dependeth not upon the Testimony of any man or Church, but wholly upon God (who is Truth it self) the Author thereof, and therefore it is to be received, because it is the Word of God.

1.5.1.E We may be moved and induced by the Testimony of the Church, to an high and reverent esteem of the holy Scripture. And the heavenliness of the Matter, the efficacy of the Doctrine, the majesty of the Style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes of the only way of mans Salvation, the the many other incomparable excellencies, and the intire perfection thereof, are Arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the Word of God; Yet notwithstanding, our full perswasion and assurance of the infallible Truth and Divine Authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the Word in our hearts.

1.6.1.E The whole Counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own Glory, Mans Salvation, Faith and Life, is either expresly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new Revelations of the Spirit, or Traditions of men. Nevertheless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the Word: And that there are some circumstances concerning the Worship of God and Government of the Church, common to humane actions and Societies, which are to be ordered by the Light of Nature, and Christian Prudence, according to the general Rules of the Word, which are always to be observed.

1.7.1.E All things in Scripture are not alike plain in themselves, nor alike clear unto all: yet those things which are necessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of Scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the unlearned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them·

1.8.1.E The Old Testament in Hebrew (which was the native Language of the People of God of old) and the New-Testament in Greek (which at the time of writing of it was most generally known to the Nations) being immediately inspired by God, and by his singular care and providence kept pure in all Ages, are therefore Authentical; so as in all Controversies of Religion the Church is finally to appeal unto them. But because these Original Tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto and interest in the Scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and search them; therefore they are to be translated into the vulgar Language of every Nation unto which they come, that the Word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the Scriptures may have hope.

1.9.1.E The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, is the Scripture it self; and therefore when there is a question about the true and full sense of any Scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it must be searched and known by other places, that speak more clearly.

1.10.1.E The Supream Judge by which all controversies of Religion are to be determined, and all Decrees of Councils, Opinions of Ancient Writers, Doctrines of men and private Spirits, are to be examined, and in whose Sentence we are to rest can be no other, but the holy Scripture delivered by the Spirit; into which Scripture so delivered, our Faith is finally resolved.

2.0.1.E {Of God and of the holy Trinity.}

2.1.1.E THere is but one onely living and true God; who is infinite in Being and Perfection, a most pure Spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passion, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almighty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute, working all things according to the Counsel of his own immutable and most righteous Will, for his own Glory, most loving, gracious, mercifull, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and withall, most just and terrible in his Judgements, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.

2.1.2.E God hath all Life, Glory, Goodness, Blessedness, in, and of himself; and is alone in, and unto himself, All sufficient, not standing in need of any Creatures which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto and upon them. He is the alone Fountain of all Being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and hath most Soveraign dominion over them, to do by them for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth: In his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible and independent upon the Creature, so as nothing is to him contingent or uncertain. He is most holy in all his Counsels, in all his Works, and in all his Commands. To him is due from Angels and Men, and every other Creature, whatsoever Worship, Service or Obedience, as Creatures, they owe unto the Creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.

2.1.3.E In the Unity of the God-head there be three Persons, of one Substance, Power, and Eternity, God the Father, God the Son and God the holy Ghost, The Father is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding, The son is eternally begotten of the Father; The holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. Which Doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our Communion with God, and comfortable dependence upon him.



21.0.1.E {Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience.}

21.1.1.E THE Liberty which Christ hath purchased for Believers under the Gospel, consist, in their freedom from the guilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God, the rigor and curse of the Law, and in their being delivered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin, from the evil of afflictions, the fear and sting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation; as also in their free access to God, and their yielding obedience unto him, not out of slavish fear, but a child-like love and willing mind: 

21.1.2.E All which were common also to Believers under the Law, for the substance of them, but under the New Testament the liberty of Christians is further inlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, the whole legal administration of the Covenant of Grace, to which the Jewish Church was subjected, and in greater boldness of access to the throne of Grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, then Believers under the Law did ordinarily partake of.

21.2.1.E God alone is Lord of the Conscience, and hath left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of men, which are in any thing contrary to his Word, or not contained in it; so that to believe such Doctrines, or to obey such Commands out of Conscience, is to betray true liberty of Conscience, and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy Liberty of Conscience, and Reason also.

21.3.1.E They who upon pretence of Christian Liberty doe practice any sin, or cherish any lust, as they doe thereby pervert the main design of the Grace of the Gospel to their own destruction; so they wholly destroy the end of Christian Liberty, which is that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the dayes of our life.


22.0.1.E {Of Religious Worship, and of the Sabbath-day.}

22.1.1.E THE light of Nature sheweth that there is a God, who hath Lordship and Soveraignty over all, is just, good, and doth good unto all, and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and served with all the heart and all the soul, and with all the might,

22.1.2.E But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God is instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will, that he may not be worshipped according to the imaginations and devices of men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible representations, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scripture.

22.2.1.E Religious Worship is to be given to God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, and to him alone; not to Angels, Saints, or any other Creatures; and since the Fall, not without a Mediator, nor in the Mediation of any other but of Christ alone.

22.3.1.E Prayer with thanksgiving, being one special part of natural worship, is by God required of all men; but that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of his Spirit, according to his Will, with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, and perseverance: and when with others, in a known tongue.

22.4.1.E Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter, but not for the dead, nor for those of whom it may be known that they have sinned the sin unto death.
22.4.1.M Peantamooonk woh aiyimun wutch wame wunneegenue naumatue teanteaguassinish, kah wutche wame eiyane missinninnuog pomantoggeeg, asuh woh ompetak pomantoggeeg, qut matta wutch napukkeeg asuh yeug uttiyeug papaume woh noowaheomun matchesepanneg en nuppooonganit,

22.5.1.E The reading of the Scriptures, Preaching and hearing of the word of God, singing of Psalms, as also the administration of Baptism and the Lords Supper, are all parts of religious worship of God, to be performed in obedience unto God with understanding, faith, reverence and godly fear.
22.5.1.M Ogketamooonk wunnetupanatamwe wussukwhonganit, Kuhkootomoadtuonk kah wuttinnoowaonk God, kotohomaonk Psalmsash, kah wonk manittoowompae usseonk Kitchissumooonk, kah Lordooe Mishadtuppooonk, wame yeush chippiyeuash manittoowompae wowussummaonk God, kah woh usseenash en noswehtauonat God, nashpe wohwohtamooonk, wunnamptamooonk, wabesuonk, kah manittooe qushaonk. 

22.5.2.E Solemn Humiliations with Fastings, and Thanksgiving upon special occasions, are in their several times and seasons to be used in an holy and religious manner.
22.5.2.M Qushae Hohpooongash nashpe Matmeetsuongash, kah Tabuttantamooonk ut nanahsiyeue ahquompiyeuash, woh moochekit nompe auwahteaunash, ut wunnetupanatamwe kah manittoowompae enniyeuonk.

22.6.1.E Neither Prayer, nor any other part of religious Worship, is now under the Gospel either tyed unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is performed, or towards which it is directed: 

22.6.2.E but God is to be worshiped every where in spirit and in truth, as in private familyes daily, and in secret each one by himself, so more solemnly in the publick Assemblyes, which are not carelesly nor wilfully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God by his word or providence calleth thereunto.

22.7.1.E As it is of the law of Nature, that in general a proportion of time by Gods appointment be set apart for the worship of God; so by his Word in a positive, moral and perpetual commandment, binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week, & from the resurrection of Christ was changed into the first day of the week, which in Scripture is called the Lords day, and is to be continued to the end of the world as the Christian Sabbath, the observation of the last day of the week being abolished.
