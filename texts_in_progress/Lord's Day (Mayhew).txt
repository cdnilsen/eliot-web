1.E BLessed be the {Lord} for such a {Day!}

2.M Kah {Lord} yeu nuttut wunnauumukqun, nishnoh noquttooweeksookeh noowehkummitchamun nanawehtouunnat ne {Kesukod}.
2.E And Blessed are we of the {Lord}, that once in every Week, we are called unto the Observation of the {Day}.

3.M Quah Sohsummooe {Kesukod}!
3.E O Glorious {Day}!

4.M uttiyeu en wame onkatogkek Kesudodash, woh yeu wuttune Sampoowoneau, {Kuttatupoat piogque Muttanonkannogdodtash nenauun!}
4.E To which all other Days may confess, {Thou art worth ten thousand of us!}

5.M Kesukod, ne anooe pahkompommukquog nehtah wame Ohquompae nechenog: {Lord koowetomuk}; {Koonanimmitch kunnuke Kesukodash}.
5.E A {Day}, that is fairer than all the Children of Time: {The Lord is with thee; Blessed art thou among the Days.}

6.M Ne {Kesukod} uttiyeu Kesukque {Kuhtahsoot wawekontog ukquhtiantamwehtouunnat}: kah ne adt pepenog woshwunumunnat Kesukque wunnunmpaukoonash wutche kuttummunke wunneechonoowooh woṣketompaog.
6.E The {Day}, which the {King of} Heaven {Delights to Honor}: and on which He chooses to open His Heavenly Treasures for the poor Children of men.


6.M Kesukod ne pahke {Kesukquinneunkquohk}, kah {Wut-idchoowompioom}, Kesukque kah Mochemohtae Nooniuonkanun.
6.E The Day which is a very {map of Heaven}, and the {Day-break} of our Heavenly and Eternal Blessedness.

7.M Kesukod uttiyeu ahhut Moocheke Nekhittit Wunnechonoh Mannit {Kesukod} ne chappohtomukup na tanummunnehkehtauunnat {Peuhtamauwaonk} Nussonchumomun Jesus Christ yeu Muttaohket.

12.M Yeu wuttissen Apostle {John} ne ummushamun {kesukod} ut {Weeksehchu}, {uttiyeu} adt {Wunnahshauanitoomoh God} ummishe {petuhshaonukup} kah wunnahtunukquannap, ne pish aniet um-Moeuwehkumonk Lord Jesus Christ, wutch ne ohquompiyeuut adt {Monchep} pache {Nahohtoeu uppeaonk.}

13.E It is madness to think, That the Apostle does not mean a {Particular day of the Week}, by that which he calls, {The Lords Day}; there would not have been any USe, or any Sense, in going to tell the {day} of his Vision, with such a Term, if it must not have so been understood.

14.M Nesunash muhshompamukquatte wunnomoonkash en wunneetuppantamwe nuppeuhtammooonkanun, yeuyeu nukqutehta pahke washaash.
14.E There are two points of much Improtance unto our Holy Religion, which now at once become Incontestable.
¶
15.M Nekone.
15.E First.

16.M Pahke unni, Pasuk Kesukod ut nishnoh Week woh unnussuppoawotomun ne chuppunnosooe ukkesukodtum LORD.
16.E It is plain, That there is {One Day in the Week}, that is, peculiarly to be acknowledged as, The LORDS-DAY.

17.M {Kesukod} uttiyeu LORD {JESUS CHRIST} pehtuh nohnoine Wattihe, Kesukod uttiyeu LORD mahche nemunnuk, nashpe Mannitooe {Kuhquttummoonk}, wutche {nehenwonche} Wuttahtoonk; Kesukod uttiyeu woh wunneetuppantamwe nanawehtauog en Lordut; kah ne unne chuppunumog kah wunnetuppantamwehtauog en peuhtamwe pogkottant[a]mooonkash.
17.E A {Day}, wherein the LORD JESUS CHRIST has a peculiar Propriety; A {Day}, which the LORD has claimed by a Divine {Institution}, for {His Own}; A {Day}, which is to be observed by us, as {Holy} unto the LORD; and accordingly to be Dedicated and Consecrated unto {Religious Purposes}
¶
18.M Kah, Nahohtoeu; Pahke unni {Ukkesukodtum} LORD paiosuke ne {Kesudod ut Weeksehchu} ne yeuyeu Wanomuhtogeg Moeu nanawehtauhittit.
18.E And, Secondly. It is plain, That the LORDS-DAY, is that very {Day of the Week}, which is now generally observed among the Faithful.

19.M Qut yeu toh unnoowasheau?
19.E But how does this appear?

20.M Yeu wutchawasheau, Ne woh mo onkatog Kesukod, kah unnoowasheau nashpe {matta channantamwe Menaonchummooonk}; ne {pahke Menaonchummooonk} wahtauwohqueog yeush {Greeke Kuttooonkash}, Η{μὲρα κυριακὴ}, unneautammoomooash {Lord ukkesukodtum}.
20.E It appears from this, Because it can be No other Day. And it appears, from {Unquestionable Tradition}; the same {Unquestionable Tradition}, which assures us, that Η{μέρα κυριακὴ}, signifies {The Lords-Day}

21.M Nuttunukkuhque pahke waehtomun ne yeu adt huttamuk {ukkesudodtum Lord} nekone kesukod ut ooweesummoo Jewsog, ne woh ane pahke waehtomuk nishnoh onkatog yeu ohhunnag unnomai; woh mo Chaguas nuppahke waehtomun ne mahche pamshunk yeu matta pahke unnowaehtoooak.
21.E We have as much Assurance, That what is here called, {The Lords day}, was the {First day} of the {Jewish Week}, as we can of any such matter; we can be sure of {Nothing} that is past, if we are not sure of {This}.

22.M Nuttannoowe pahke unnoowae[k]tomun, piosuke ne {Kesukod} yeu {Ussoowetamunnap} kah matta onkatog chuppe {ne}, ut wame negone Christiane Sohkuppomantamooonkash
22.E We do most certainly know, That this was the {Name} of that very {Day}, and of none by {That}, in all the first Ages of Chrsitianity.

23.M Pahke nuttun waehtomun, {Clemens}, {Justin Martyr}, {Irenæus}, {Origen}, {Tartullian}, kah pasque waantamwe mukkinneonkash, kah wame Moeuwehkumonkane Wussuhkwhonganonchummooonkash, yeu wunnaquahchae unnoowohtamunneau.
23.E We are certain, That {Clemens}, that {Justin Martyr}, that {Irenæus}, that {Origin}, that {Tertullian}, that whole Councils, and all Church History, have all along so taken it.

24.M Nux Nunnitchekonunnonut ahtaash OOsuhquahhonkash {Ignatius}, Wassuhquahhamukuppash, {John} wasuhquahhog {OOwoshwunnummooonk}, papaume {Swosuk} asuh Piogque kottummoo wuttuh issuh; kah yeush nuttukqunnonash ne kesukod ahhuttamuk, Ukkesukodtum LORD, ne Kesukod Nussonchumomun adt {Omohkep wutch nuppoonkanut}; kah nag matta kot Jewse-asechek, woh oonetuppantamwe nanawehtouunneau ne kesukod en Lordut; qut matta ne Kesukod yeu nakonuhshotamuk.
24.E Yea, we have in our Hands the Composures of {Ignatius}, written within Eight or Ten years of {John's} writing the {Revelation}, which tell us, That the Day called, {The} LORDS DAY, was the Day of our {Lords Rising from the Dead}; and that they who would not Live in {Judaism}, should observe {this day}, and not the day before it, as Holy unto the Lord.

25.M {Pliny} matta Peuhtamwe Nanawinuwaenin, ut OOsuhquahhunkanut en Kuhtahsoot {Trajan}, noh Kohtohsootummoowehpoh ne Apostle {John} wunnupun, unonchummoo, Christiansog pamontagpane ne ohquompiyeuut wuttahtouunnaous pasuk {Kuhquttosooe Kesukod} ne ohhut naquahchae moehtit wawenomonat CHRIST.
25.E {Pliny}, a Pagan Governour, in a Letter to {Tra[g]an}, the Emperour, in whose Reign the Apostle {John} died, reports, That the Christians then had a {stated day} in which they still met for the Praising of CHRIST.

26.M Kah nuttunwaehtomun yeu {Piosuke ne Kesukod}.
26.E And we all know, That it was {This very day.}
¶
27.M Newutche yeuyeu wane channoowae ushquhshatuh en nesunash matta channantamwe {pakodtuttumooonkash}.
27.E Let us then without any Disputation, pass on to two indisputable {Propositions}.
¶
4.1.M Nekone PAKODTUTTUMOOONK.
4.1.E The First PROPOSITION.

4.2.M Ut {nukqutweeksooe Omppuntshomoonkanut} nukqutohteau {Kesukod} uttiyeu ummissinninumoh Manit woh nanawehtauhittit neane {Lord ukkesukodum}, kah neane {Sabbath} en {Lordut}.
4.2.E There is a {Day} in the {Weekly Revolution}, which is to be observed by the People of God, as the {Lords-Day}, and a {Sabbath} to the Lord.

4.3.M Ut nishnoh weekse ohquompiyeuut nunnaquahchae quishke peaonukkumun, nukqut {Kesukquae ohquompi}, ne annuhtuhquahseog Winnetuppantamwe Nanawehtauunnate en Kehche ohquompiue Lordut
4.3.E In every {Week} of {Time}, there does revur one {Day} of {Time}, which we are bound for to keep {Holy} unto the Great {Lord of Time}.

4.4.M Yeu wunnomuhtammooonk pish unnumminnehkehtosoo, woh mo wuttiṣkunumunnat nashpe yeu wutcheai.
4.4.E This Faith will be rendred Impregnable by this proof.

4.5.M Waṣke kitchishik Muttaohk Kesukque God, chuppunnumup, pasuk {Kesukkod ut nesausuk tashukqunne ohquom[ip]yeuut}, woh winnetuppantamwe, nanawehtouunnat en wohhagkat.
4.5.E The God of Heaven, did at the very Beginning of the World, set apart a {Seventh Day of Time}, to be kept {Holy} unto Himself.

4.6.M Mamaiattuh ne kuttooonk, {Mehquantash}, adt kitchishik yauwe nomatooonk noowekummukqun Ompammuhquaenat en ne adt wuṣke kuhquttumukup Sabbath, waṣke kitchishik Muttaahk.
4.6.E It may be, the word, {Remember}, at the Beginning of the Fourth Commandment, may invite us to look back unto the first Appointment of the {Sabbath}, at the Beginning of the World.

4.7.M Newutche, Sun woh anooe pahkwomoo kuttooonk, nehtah ne aketomog, Gen. 2 2,3. {Nesausuk attashukqunnogok God uppakodchehtouunnap wuttannukosooonk ne mahche ayukup: kah anwosunup nesausuk attashukqunnogog wutch wame wutta[n]uhkosooonkannit ne kesehtunkup; Kah God OOnantamunnap nesausuk attashukqunnogok kah ne OOnetuppantamwehtouunnap}.
4.7.E For, Can any thing be more positive, than what we read? {Gen.} 2 2,3 {On the Seventh Day God Ended His Work which He had made, and He Rested on the Seventh Day, from all His Work which He had made; And God blessed the Seventh day, and Sanctified it}.

4.8.M Chaguas mah {wuttanwosunnooonk God, nesausuk attushukqunnagok}?
4.8.E What was the {Resting of God} on the {Seventh day}?

4.9.M Matta wutcheaiunnooup woh katinne Matta-Peuhtamweninuog yeu wuttinne Mamoshquohkontamunnaout ne unnuhquattummooonk; Mamoshquaohhahtit {Sabbath,} neane.--- {Delassati mollis Immago Dei}. Noochumwe wuttinsooonk Sauwunnummooe Mannit.
4.9.E There was no occasion for the old Heathen to scoff and jeer at the EXpression; flouting at the {Sabbath}, as,----- {Delassati mollis Imago Dei}.

4.10.M Mat; God {wuttanwosun[n]ooonk} ne matta wepe unnautamun, {wuttahquehtoonk} ne {nukquttuh tashukqunne} mahche mah adt naquah[c]haanuhkosit, qut wonk {Wuttapinnauwatooonk}, ut ne wuttannuhkosooonkanut.
4.10.E No; The {Resting of God}, was His not only {Ceasing} from the {Work}, which He had for {six days} together been carrying on, but also taking {Satisfaction} in the {Work} which had been so far carried on.

4.11.M Kah onk woh yeu mehquantamun, {God OOnantamunnap nesausuk attashukqunnogok}.
4.11.E For a Commemoration hereof, {God blessed the Seventh day,}

4.12.M Yeu nautamun neane ut ohsuhkom[u]nooe kuttooonk; {Ne OOnetuppantamwehtouunnap}.
4.12.E That is, as it follows, {He Sanctified it.}

4.13.M Kah, yeu toh woh unnautamun, chippe wuttannooohamooonk, woh ne noonetuppantamwe nanawehtouunnanonut en wohhogkat; Nuttannoonukqunnonup woh ne {noonetuppantamwehtouunnanonut}, asuh nutchuppu[n]numunnanonut, en wunnetuppantamoe auwohchaonkash. 
4.13.E And, what can this mean, but that He Enjoined the {Keeping} of it by us, as {Holy} unto Himself; He required, that we should {Sanctify} it, or Separate it for Sacred Uses.

5.1.M Matta woh mussahhamun onkatog ahankonunkquoh unnautammooonk.
5.1.E It is impossible to give any other tolerable Interpretation.

5.2.M Nux wunnekin qut Toh ohquompi nesausuk attashukqunnogok yeu unnoowunnetuppantamwehtouunnas?
5.2.E Well; But when was the {Seventh day} so {Sanctified}?

5.3.M Yeu ussenap woṣketomp ne adt woh wuṣke kakenawe tapunnukup, wohwohtamehhonat, ne anakup.
5.3.E It was as Early as man could well be capable of being informed, that so it was.

5.4.M Howan unnoowat God OOnetuppantamwehtoonk {nesausuk kesukod}, wutch waṣke kitchishik Muttaohk; [Heb 4 4.] wepe unnautamun ukquahshae kesantammooonk, pish pasuk peamese wuttohchimmoin ut {Judeae} ohkeut ne wunnanawehtouunneau, nese Muttanonk kah yauwe Paṣkooe kottummoo wuttuh issuh; woh wussome nanahtoenunkquet, kah koshki ne ohhunnag Nekonmushommooonk
5.4.E To say, That God {Sanctified the Seventh day} from the Beginning, even {from the Foundation of the World}; [Heb. 4. 4] only be determining that it should four and twenty Hundred years afterwards be kept by one Little People in the Land of {Judea}, methinks 'tis a very rude and harsh Anticipation.

5.5.M Nahwutche wuttinnantamunneau annoohchamooonk woh wunnetuppantamwehtouunnat Sabbath wuṣke wunnunummoatinnap ut {Mara} tah tauwohkamukqut, qut nag kanhagk[o]g wutche yeu unnantammooonk chanuk unnomahshaog en ne at anooe kuppoooiak nehtah ne adt unnantamwehtit, Sabbath yeu tanukkitchishin.
5.5.E It is a Fancy of some, that the Command for an {Holy Sabbath}, was of no ancienter a Date, than the Station of {Israel}, at {Mara} in the Wilderness; But the Patrons of that Fancy do quickly run themselves into a greater Wilderness, than that wherein they suppose the {Sabbath} to have had its Original.

5.6.M Nux {Moses} wahquttummonuhshont ummissinninumoh, Exod. 3. 18. {Woh nag wuttonnoowout Touwohkamukqut Sephammaunônat Jehovah um-Mannittoomoowoah}, noh auwuttamup, woh nag wunnonche assoomanummooe nanawehtanunaout {Sabbath} en Lordut; newutche {Sabbath} ne mah {Sephosooe Kesukod}.
5.6.E Yea, when {Moses} demanded for his people, Exod. 3. 18. {That they might go into the Wilderness, to Sacrifice unto the Lord their God}; his Demand was, That they might go and keep an undisturbed {Sabbath} unto the Lord; For the {Sabbath} was the {Day of Sacrifices}.

5.7.M Neane wame unnussumpoowaog, Jewsog nowat nanawehtopaneg wunnetuppantamoe Sabbath, nishnoh weekus; kah Jewse Sonchummoog unnussumpoowaog {Abraham} wonk wunnetupanatamwe Sabbath nanawehtooop; netatupe wutcheaiyeuoo unnantamunnat, OOnetuppantammoomoh God asquam Mashtammogkottunnook noh wuss[a]hsummoehhopaneh nashpe {wunnetuppantamwe Sabbath} nishnoh noquttooweeksookeh.
5.7.E As 'tis confessed by all, that an {Holy Sabbath} every Week was observed by the Jews of Old; and the Jewish Rabbins confess, That {Abraham} also kept the {Holy Sabbath}; So there is cause to think, that the Saints of God, before the {Flood}, Glorified Him with an {Holy Sabbath} every Week.

5.8.M Kah ne annuhquattuk {Paræus}, {Sabbath wunnetuppantamwehtouunnap ut wutchashninneônkannoowout}, nekonne wuttoohshinoog.
5.8.E And that, as {Paræus} Expresses it, {The Sanctification of the Sabbath was observed in the Patriarchal Families}.

5.9.M Nux nuttunaketosumun papaume {Kain} kah {Abel}, Gen. 4 3. {Ohquahshunk Kesukodash nag patooopaneg Ummakooonkannoo en Lordut}.
5.9.E Yeah, when we read of {Cain} and {Abel} Gen. 4. 3. {At the End of Days}, they brought their Offerings unto the Lord,

5.10.M Matta channantamenunkquet, yeu unnauuttamun nag nesh upattauunnaoh {Sabbath dayeu}.
5.10.M it means doubtless, That on the {Sabbath day} they brought their Offerings.

6.1.M Kah pehpehtawe nanawompattamooonk {nesausuk attashukqunnogok, mashtommogohk}, monaog Kehche wahtoeninuog wuttunnantamhukqunneau, wonk Sabbath matta wutchukkuppohhomunnap {Arkut}, woh na matta tannunnanawehtouunnat.
6.1.E And the Repeated Observation of a {Seventh day}, in the Time of the {Flood}, hath made Learned men conjecture, That in the {Ark} too, the Keeping of an {Holy Sabbath}, was  not shut out of Doors.
¶
6.2.M Nattootumwehchaonk.
6.2.E A Quæstion.
¶
6.3.M {Tohwutche kuhquttumunnas Sabbath?}
6.3.E {But why was the Sabbath Instituted?}
¶
6.4.M Ahque monuhtiekq kenau notieaque nah mussohhommauunog yeush Christiane unnantammooonkash.
6.4.E Let it not seem strange unto my Hearers, if I propose these {Christian Thoughts} unto them.
¶
6.5.M Nekone; Kohquttumuk wunnetuppantamwe Sabbath wutch waṣke kitchishik, ne ut wae nattonumop {Lord-Messiah} (asuch Christ) kah matta wepe {Kessehtoe} qut wonk {Mannoohwhae} annuhkosooonk mehquantamunnap ut ne kuhquttumooonkanehchu.
6.5.E First; In the Appointment of the {Holy Sabbath}, from the Beginning, there was a special Regard unto our {Lord-Messiah}; and not only the Work of {Creation}, but also the Work of {Redemption}, was regarded in the Appointment.

6.6.M Nashpe muhsi wutcheae unnoowomoo, Mark 2. 28. {Wosketomp wunnamonoh uppioquttumun Sabbath.}
6.6.E Most Reasonably it is said, {Mar.} 2. 28. {The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.}

6.7.M Sabbath pahke wuttauwamukqun wunnamonuoh woṣketomp; kah matta nutchannantammoo nussinnat, yeu aionioop nachah waṣke kitchishik.
6.7.E The {Sabbath} has a special Respect unto the {Son of Man}; and I make no stick to say, {It always} had so.

6.8.M Nummoochukohtomun wutcheai unnantamunnat, ne {nakonohtogup Sabbath} kumma ohtop woṣketomp mahche {pinnishat}; {Nukquttuh attashukqunnogok} pehtuh ne Kesukod woṣketomp adt keshuttup, ne wuttut pinnishshonah.
6.8.E There is abundance of cause to think, That the {Fall} of Man was before the {First Sabbath}; on the {Sixth Day}, even on the Day whereon man was made, he {Fell}.

6.9.M Unnoowomoo, Psal 49. 12. {Woṣketomp matta nukquttuttipohkahchoooup Ukquahtiantammooonkanut; Pinnishop aque mussunnohkontooonk neane puppunnahshimog neg auwohkohpunnacheg} ({asuh naputcheg})
6.9.E We are told, Psal. 49 12. {Man continued not a Night in his Excellence; He fell under Dominion, like the Beasts that perish}:

6.10.M Asquam wanunkoounnookup, Mattannit noh wuttauwohkuhpunnae mussunnohkonop:
6.10.E Before {Night}, Satan obtained an horrible {Dominion} over him.

6.11.M Qut paiomoouk negone Sabbath (asuh anwosunnooe Kesukod) ne wuttapehhukqunnah pinnishae woṣketomp (neane kehkinnasit, wunnekinnooe {Alting} noh waṣkinninue) nashpe ne mushkouantamonchummooonk papaume Mannoohoowaenin, uppohquahwunnukqunnat wutch wame yeush uhquanummooonkash uttiyeu {Kottun-ashkook}, ({Mattannit}) pahtunkup ut wohhogkat
6.11.E The Arrival of the {First Sabbath} comforted {Fallen Man}, (as the Excellent {Alting}, the younger, observes,) with the Joyful Tidings of a {Redeemer}, to Rescue him from the Confusions which the {Old Serpent} had brought upon him.

6.12.M {Sabbath} wutche Kuhquttumunnap nohtuhkonat, Kessehtoonk toh inne wunnekin, kah wame Manehkesit toh inne tapinneuwatooup panuppehtunk wunnitchekane onuhkosooonkash.
6.12.E The {Sabbath} is to Celebrate the {Perfection} of the {Creation}, and the {Pleasure} which the Almighty took in perfecting the {Works} of His Hands.

6.13.M Nux, qut wuttannuhkosooonkash God muttae mamoshkehtosoopash nashpe woṣketomp {ummatche usseonk}, ne chanuk noh adt ussep.
6.13.E Yea, but the {Works} of God, were wofully defaced by the {Sin} of man, presently committed upon them.

7.1.M Yeush moohche {wiṣkehtauunash} kah {wussehtouunash} nashpe {Mannoohhoowae Nuppohquohsoowaeninumun}, nish panippehtouunnat; nish matta {panippehtosunnooash, Mannohhoowae nussonchummomun} toh Sahke matta annuhkosit nish wame wadchonumunnat wutch weṣke unni[u]onkanut, kah wuṣke aiumunnat nishnoh chag.
7.1.E There must be a {Renovation} and a {Restitution} of these {Works} by our Lord-Redeemer, for the {perfecting} of them; they are not {perfected} without and until our Lord-Redeemers undertaking to Save all from Desolation, and {make all things New}.

7.2.M Yeu wutche {Sabbath} matta kuhquttumunnap wepe wawenotumunnat, ne annakuppash kessehtoe annuhkosooonkash asquam panshont woṣktomp, qut wonk wawenotumunnat ne momonantamwe quahshaweonk ne God aiukup, woṣketomp mahche matcheusset, mahquahtauunnat {kessehtoe annuhkosooonkash} wutch weṣke unniuonkanut, kah nesh tashunumunnat en anooe qunnuhque panippeuonkanehchu, nehtah nekonae, nashpe {Mannoohtooe Annuhkosooonkash}.
7.2.E Wherefore the {Sabbath} was to Celebrate, not only the State, wherein the {Works of Creation} were before the Fall of man, but also to Celebrate the Wonderful Provision which God made upon the Fall of man, to Rescue the {Works of Creation} from Ruine, and Raise them to an higher {perfection} than ever, in the {Works of Redemption}.

7.3.M Nissim, Sabbath Kuhquttumunnap wutch waṣke Kitchishik, nohtukkonat kah wawenotumunnat ne annuhkosooonk uttiyeu {nussonchummomun Messiah} wunnoowae nemunnukup woh wuttissenat wutche Muttaahk.
7.3.E It was for a Celebration of what our {Lord-Messiah} has undertaken to do for the World, that an {Holy Sabbath} was at the Beginning Instituted.
¶
7.4.M Nahohtoeu; Wunnanummukqsooe God, OOche kuhquttumunnap wunnetuppantamwe {Sabbath}, wutch waṣke kitchishik Muttaahk, onk woh yeu wun-nashpe {kaken[o]wehhon} matcheseae woṣketompaog, wutche ne wunniuonk woh attumunumuk ut onkatog kah anooe wanekuk Muttaahket,
7.4.E Secondly; the {End} of the Blessed God, in Appointing an {Holy Sabbath}, from the Beginning of the World, was herewithal to {prepare} Fallen man, for the Blessedness of another and a better World.

7.5.M nuttinne kunnoonitchamun, Heb. 4. 9 {Uhpomohteau Anwosunnooonk wutche Ummissinninumoh God.}
7.5.E We are advised, Heb. 4 9. {There doth Remain a Rest for the People of God.}

7.6.M Wunnantooonkkanuoooo ne quahshawunummouut ummissinninumoh {Lord Messiah} wutch {waṣke kitchishik Muttaahk}.
7.6.E There is a {Blessedness} prepared for the people of the {Lord-Messiah} from the {Foundation of the World}.

7.7.M Ne wunninuonk pish anwosunnooonkanuoooo wutch wame ne matta wanammattammooog.
7.7.E That {Blessedness} will be a {Rest} from all that is uneasy to us;

7.8.M Anwosunnooonk wutch wame tahnoocheuonkash, kah moohmooshhittooonkash, {yeu matchetooe} Muttaohket; {anwosuunooonk} ut nummohtae ompuhkooonkanut God, noh pish wameyeuoouk nish$noh$ut en nohhoganonut.
7.8.E a {Rest} from all the vanities and vexations of this {present Evil World}; a {Rest} in the full Enjoyment of God, becoming {All} in {All} into us.

7.9.M Kah yeu matta mahchiue unnantammooonk, unnantamunnat {Nesausuk Sohkohquompak, nesausuk Muttanonk} ut ne Sahkohtunk yeu Muttaahk, pish pasooche pattooomoo ne Mannittooe {Anwosunnooonk}.
7.9.E And it is no empty Notion, That the {Seventh period}, the {Seventh Chiliad} of the World, will bring on that {Rest} of God.

7.10.M Yeuyeu, neane {wunnetuppant[a]mwe} Sabbath {K[o]hkinnasooonkanuook}, nahtuhkonat nattahtoonkanun ne {Michemohtae Sa[b]summooonk}, uttiyeu pish adt {wanotukkeg} Anwosunnehtit wutch wuttannuhkosooonkannoowout:
7.10.E Now, the {Holy Sabbath}, as 'tis a {Sign} of our Title to that {Eternal Sabbatism}, wherein the {Blessed} shall {Rest from their Labours}:

8.1.M Nag ne nanawehtunkeg na {tannussealhommou[o]neau} matta wohkuhquohshinnooe wunniuonk ut Kesukque Muttaahket: Nemehkuh wonk, ne papane auwohchaonk woh nashpe kakenauwehchaog wutche {Wunniue nuttanwosunnooonkanun}.
8.1.E They who keep it, have the {Eternal Blessedness} of the Heavenly World therein {Seal'd} unto them: So, 'tis a notable {Mean} to fit us for our {Blessed Rest}.

8.2.M Woṣktomp matta matche ussesoh nishnoh Kesukod Weeksehchu woh kakooche anogquinnunkquattuh Sabbath neanag; qut na[e]hoh Matcheusseog nummahche nashpe nuhkuhkunkumun monatash Muttaohke wuttammantommooonkash, muttae quenauwatta nutchuppunnummontchannanonut {Pasuk Kesukod ut nesausuk tahshinash}, ammanumunnat Muttaahke nottammantamooonkanunnonash, kah wepe woh nooweche ussoomomun God ut nesh usseonkash, woh quahshawehqueog wutche {Michemohtae noniuonkanun}.
8.2.M If man had not Sinn'd, Every Day of the Week, would have been more like a {Sabbath}; but since our Sin has plung'd us into so many Cares of this World, it is highly necessary for us to be accommodated with {One Day in Seven}, for to Lay aside our Worldly Cares, and be wholly taken up in Fellowship with God, and in those things, which are to fit us four our {Eternal Blessedness}.
¶
8.3.M Nahohtoeue PAKOTTUTTUMMOOONK.
8.3.E The Second PROPOSITION.
¶
8.4.M Tapinnunkquet woh mussikkenooe God ukkuhquttumun ne Kesukod ut Weeksooe {Uhhopuntshomooonkanut} uttiyeu nakum annantog woh nanawehtauun, neane nootetuppantamwe Sabbatoomun; kah yeuyeu ukkuhquttumun ne {Kesukod} ut Weeksehchu, Nussanchummomun adt Omohkep wutch nuppooonkanut.
8.4.E 'Tis fit that the Great God should Appoint, {which day} in the {Weekly Revolution} He will have to be observed as our {Holy Sabbath}; and He does now Appoint the {Day} of the Week, whereon our {Lord Rose} from the Dead.

8.5.M Yauwe nomatooonk, wepe weogquttummoomoo {Pasuk Kesukod ut nesausuk tahshunash} woh nawehtomuk neane Sabbath-day.
8.5.E Our {Fourth Commandment} speaks only of {One day in seven}, to be kept as a {Sabbath day}.

8.6.M Kah wunnetuppantamwe Wun-Nashauanittoomoh God, mahche Sohchukquanumoh ummissinninnumoh God, {Chague Kesukod}, ut weeksehchu ummahche pepenamun, kah kuhquttumun.
8.6.E And the Holy {Spirit of God} hath signified unto the People of God, {which day of the seven}, He hath pitched upon.

8.7.M 
8.7.E That which was the {Sabbath-day} under the {Old Testament}, was the same that has been thought generally to have been the {Seventh-day} from the {Creation}.

8.8.E And 'tis clear, that the {Day} following it, is by the Direction of the Holy Spirit, now become our {Holy Sabbath}; even the Day of our {Lords Resurrection from the Dead}.

8.9.E Our Lord Lying in His Grave, all the {Old Sabbath}, has left that {Old Sabbath} buried there.

8.10.E And some have remarked a curious Agreeableness, in the Translation of the {Sabbath} from the {Last day} of the Week, to the {First}.

9.1.E The {Jewish Sabbath}, had a little strain of the {Old Covenant} in it; First the {Working days}, and then the Promise of {Rest} and {Life}.

9.2.E But the {Christian Sabbath} has a greater strain of the {New-Covenant} in it; which first gives the Believer the Promise of {Rest} and {Peace}; before he does the {Works of Righteousness}.
¶
9.3.E This is very sure; There appears no Day so suitable for our {Holy Sabbath}, as the Day whereon our Lord-Redeemer, {Finishing} His Work of Redemption {Triumphed} over the Enemies and Hindrances of our Salvation.

9.4.E It is required, (for so 'tis to be rendered,) Isa. 58. 13. {Thou shalt call the Sabbath a Delight}, (i.e. Keep it as a Day of Holy Delight,) {unto the Holy one of the Lord, the Glorified} (or Victorious) {One}.

9.5.E It is our Lord Jesus Christ, who is, {The Holy One of God}.

9.6.E It was on the {Day} of his {Resurrection}, that our Lord was {Glorified} and Victorious.

9.7.E The {Sabbath} being a Day for us to {Delight} in the {Holy One}, and in his {Victories}, what {Fitter day} can we have to be our {Sabbath-Day}, than the {Day of His Victories}?

9.8.E Had we been left unto our own Conduct, what fitter Day could we have chosen for our {Sabbath}, than a Day so Ennobled?

9.9.E {Samuel} argued for {Souls} being chosen, because there was {none like him}, a man higher than the rest of the People.

9.10.E Truly, This Day is advanced by our Lords {Resurrection} upon it, and made much Taller than any of the Seven, Why should we not say, {Behold, the Day which the Lord has chosen}!

10.1.E It was therefore foretold in the {Old-Testament}, That the Day of our {Lords Resurrection} would be the {Holy Sabbath} of His People.

10.2.E We read, Psal. 110 3 {Thy People shall} be a People of {Free-will-Offerings, in the Day of thy Power}.

10.3.E The Day of our {Lords Resurrection} from the Dead, was eminently the {Day of His Power}: He was, {Declared the Son of God with Power}, by the {Resurrection from the Dead}.

10.4.E Well, and this is to be the Day for His People to bring their {Free-will-Offerings} unto Him.----Compare, Psal. 118. 24.

10.5.E And the Singular Honour then sometimes put upon the {Eighth Day}, (the Day after the {Seventh}, seems to have carried in it, a prediction of our {Christian Sabbath}.
¶
10.6.E But that which may procure an Everlasting {Rest} unto the {Sabbatarian Controversy}, is this; and there needs no more: 'Tis the {Lords-Day!}

10.7.E That's enough to prove, that is by the Institution of Heaven, to be kept {Holy} unto the LORD.
¶
10.8.E We may add; The {Day} which both the {Præcept} and the {Pattern} of the Holy Apostles, have commended unto us for our {Holy Sabbath}, is the Day for it Commanded by our Lord Himself.

10.9.E But such is the Day, which we now observe as the LORDS DAY.

10.10.E {Baronius} with very good Reason sayes, "That all who are in their Witts, will say, that since it is found, that the LORDS DAY was observed in the Apostles Times, it could not be ordained and Commanded to be kept of any other but of themselves."

10.11.E And you know the Consequence!

10.12.E 'Tis well judged by {Tertullian}; "The Apostles chose nothing which they brought in at their own pleasure, but faithfully appointed unto the Nations the Discipline which they received from Christ."

11.1.E Indeed, tho' the {Resurrection of our Lord} had Consigned over unto this Day of ours, all the Rights of the {Holy Sabbath}, yet it is probable, the Day was not compleatly advanced into the practise of the Faithful, until the Day of {Pentecost}, which was not until {Seven times seven} Days after it.

11.2.E Our Lord Jesus Christ had, its true, several Times put a singular Honour on this Day, by His chusing to Exhibit Himself unto his Disciples upon it.

11.3.E But when the Advancement of our Lord Jesus Christ was Consummated, in {Sitting at the Right hand of God}, He poured out His {Holy Spirit} on His Apostles.

11.4.E That pouring out of the {Holy Spirit}, which Revealed the whole will of God unto them, was on {that very day}.

11.5.E And from {that very day}, we find the Apostles distinguishing the {Day} as {Holy} unto the Lord.
¶
11.6.E They distinguish'd it by their {Precept}: 1 Cor 16. 2. {Upon the First Day of the Week, Let every one of you lay by him in store.}

11.7.E Why should the {First day of the week} be preferr'd before any other Day, for the Faithful to Assemble unto the {Service of the Lord}: There can be no Reason given, but because it is the {Sabbath of the Lord}.
¶
11.8.E They distinguish'd it by their {Pattern}: Acts 20. 7. {Upon the First day of the week, the Disciples came together and} Paul {Preached unto them}.

11.9.E Why should the {First day of the Week} be the only Day in {Seven} (for so long had {Paul} been there,) for the Disciples to {Come together}?

11.10.E There can be no Reason given, but because it was become the {Sabbath} unto them.

11.11.E In short, We are arm'd with Confessions from the greatest Adversaries of the {Sabbath}, "That the Observation of the {Lords Day}, was received by the common consent of all the Churches in the World, even from and in the Apostles Days, and this with the Approbation and Authority of the Apostles themselves."

12.1.E Now the Apostles directed the Churches to nothing, but what they had a Commission from the Lord Jesus Christ, and a Direction from His Holy Spirit for.

¶

12.2.E In fine; If the {Jewish Sabbath} be abrogated, then some {other day} must be kept, as the {Christian Sabbath}.

12.3.E But no {other day} pretends to be so, besides the Day now kept among the Faithful.

12.4.E The Abrogation of the {Jewish Sabbath}, is very peremptory; Col. 2 16. {Let no man Judge you, in respect of the Sabbath-days.}

12.5.E The {Weekly Sabbath-days} observed among the Jews, must be the only Things intended, when it is said. {Let no man judge you in respect of them}; That is, let no man go to Impose them upon you, or {Judge} that you Sin, if you do not keep them.

12.6.E Some {Sabbath} must be kept; The {Jewish Sabbath} mayn't be kept; It remains, that our {Christian Sabbath} take the place of it.
¶
12.7.M MUHSOGQUNUMMOOONK asuh, AUWOHCHAONK.
12.7.E APPLICATION.
¶
12.8.E But shall we then, O Christians, Apply our selves unto the most Religious Observation of the {Lords-day}? This is the point that is to be this Day managed in the Publick Exhortations.

12.9.E The point, and the CASE now before us, is,
¶
12.10.E {How is the} LORDS-DAY, {to be Observed by the People of the Lord}?
¶
12.11.E Our Lord said with an Eye to this very Day, Joh. 8. 56. {Abraham rejoyced to see my day, he saw it & was glad.}

12.12.E He saw it, when He saw his {Isaac} Raised from the Dead.

13.1.E How much more may we Rejoyce, O Christians?

13.2.E We {see} the {Day} of our Lord every Week.

13.3.E Don't we {see} it {Joyfully}?

13.4.E I hope we do.

13.5.E But God grant, that we may {see} it {Holily} too, {see} it {Watchfully}, and {see} it {Fruitfully}.

13.6.E In the primitive Times, it was the very {Character}, by which the Christians were discovered. {A Conscientious Observation of the} LORDS DAY.

13.7.E If one of them had it asked of him; {Servasti Dominicum}? Have you kept the LORDS DAY?

13.8.E He would answer, {Christianus sum, Intermittere non possum}: I am a Christian, and I dare to do no other.

13.9.E {Christians}, I am now to Exhort you, That you would Retain and Maintain your {Character}. ¶ But,

13.10.E {I.} I cannot proceed so hopefully as I Desire, to recommend the Observation of the LORDS DAY, till I have prevail'd with my Hearers, to call it by its true Christian Name, of THE LORDS DAY, (or, The {Sabbath}, which is also a Scripture, and a proper Name for i[t]:) and not Forget and Affront Christianity, by calling it SUN-DAY, as too many too often do.

13.11.E I must assure you, To keep up the {Right Names} of Things in matters of Religion, has no little Tendency to keep up {Right Thoughts} of the Things themselves.

13.12.E Wise men have sometimes been justly apprehensive, of more mischief lurking in {Bare Names}, than is commonly apprehended by those that use them.

13.13.E I remember an unhappy passge of the {Romish} and {Rhemish} Annotators upon the New-Testament; say they, concerning the Protestants, {While they say} Ministers, {let us say}, Priests; {when they call it}, A Communion Table, {let us call it}, An Altar.

14.1.E {Let us keep our old Words, and we shall keep our old Things}.

14.2.E Truly, Sirs; you are much in the Right on't!

14.3.E But what will you say, When I tell you, That the {Rhemish} Annotators themselves, [on Rev. 1. 10.] condemn the Name of {Sunday} as Heathenish?

14.4.E I will not quote unto you the complaints even of no better a man than {Polydore Virgil}, about our keeping up the {Planetary Names} for the {Days}.

14.5.E I will only say, every Body knows, that the {Pagans} were they, who first called this Day, by the Name of {Sunday}; and that it was a stroke of their {Idolatry} to call it so, that is to say, 'twas to Express the Dedication of the Day unto the Oldest and Brightest {Idol} in the World.

14.6.E If any of those {Pagans}, might now give their {Balaamitick} Advice, how to make People insensible of the Reverence due to, {The} LORDS DAY, they would say, By all means keep up our {Idolatrous Name} for the Day, and never let it be call'd any other than, {Sunday}.

14.7.E But Sirs, if it be, The LORDS DAY, let us not be shy of honestly calling it so!

14.8.E Surely, we are not ashamed of confessing our LORD, or of confessing that This Day belongs unto Him.

14.9.E We may before we are aware, {Take the Lords Name in Vain}, by not allowing to the {LORDS DAY}, the {Name} which He has Himself challenged for it: The {Third} and the {Fourth} Commandments may be together violated, in our denying the {Name} of the LORD, unto the {Day} of the LORD.

15.1.E Have any of my Hearers, a secret Inclination to bring or keep the LORDS DAY under {Contempt}?

15.2.E {Beloved, we are perswaded better things of you!}

15.3.E But would not the Royal Person who is now placed at the Head of Three mighty Kingdoms, count it a contempt of Her Majesty, if People should now call Her nothing but, {The Princess of Denmark}?

15.4.E And I am the more free in making use of this comparison, because the Jews do very agreeably call the {Sabbath-day}, by that Name, {The Queen of all the Dayes}: And {Ignatius} puts upon the {Lords-day} too, that very Title.

15.5.E It is true, some of the Ancients, as both {Justin Martyr} and {Tertullian}, do sometimes, in their {Apologies}, call the {Lords-day}, by the Name of, {Sunday}; But there is this to be {Apologised} for them, That they directed their Apologies unto the {Pagans}, who would not have readily understood another Name.

15.6.E And now that you may not count me {more Nice than Wise}, I will quote you a few more of the Ancients, to whom, if you please, the matter shall be referr'd.

15.7.E First, the great {Ambrose} has a Passage of this Import, {The Day which is called,} The Lords day {in the Church, is called} Sunday, {by the men of the World}.

15.8.E And then, the greater {Austin}, shows, that the {Manichees} rather than the {Christians} called, {The Lords day}, by the Name of {Sunday}; but, says he, {For our parts, we call it the} Lords day, {because on it, we reverence not the Sun, but the Resurrection of the Lord.}

15.9.E And elsewhere, he is very earnest, for that {Heathen-Name} to be laid aside: says he, {'Tis a manner of speaking, that becomes not a Christian Mouth.}

15.10.E Add hereto, That {Philastrius} would have the use of this Name with Christians reckoned little short of {Hæretical}.

16.1.E If my Hearers don't Relish, what I have now said, they may go quarrel with the Ashes of those Venerable Fathers. 

16.2.E I have done with it!
¶
16.3.E {II.} From the {Name}, Let us come to the {Thing}.

16.4.E Since we {Enjoy}, The LORDS DAY, Let us {Employ} it as the {Lords-Day}, and keep it {Holy}, and give it {Wholly}, unto the LORD.

16.5.E Christians, 'Tis no little Favour of our Lord unto us, that He has {Appointed} One Day in Seven for a Religious Observation with us, and that He has {Acquainted} us with His Appointment.

16.6.M {Queh num-Mannittoom, ut nesnehchake Kodtumae ohquompiyeuut, kummahche unnunummah, matta wepe nukqut Muttanonkane Sabbattash}; Qut naut matta wepe, {Piogque Muttanonkanne Monanchaonkash.}
16.6.E {Ah, Lord, In Twenty years Time, thou hast given me more than One Thousand Sabbaths}; But therein, more than {Ten Thousand Mercies}.

16.7.E It is mention'd as a Signal Favour, to the Ancient People of God, Neh. 9. 14. {Lord, Thou madest known unto them, thy Holy Sabbath}.

16.8.E Truly, there is no {Sabbath-breaker}, but what is chargeable with an {Hyperboly} of {Ingratitude!}

16.9.E Certainly, we are {Lifted up to Heaven,} when our Lord allows us, yea, Invites us, yea, Commands us, to Spend one Day of Seven, in the very {Suburbs of Heaven}, above all Earthly Avocations.

16.10.E If this {Commandment be Grievous} unto us, where is the {Love} to our Lord Jesus Christ, or to our own Souls, and how monstrous is our Ingratitude?

16.11.E Come, Let us with all possible Thankfulness and Chearfulness, accept the {Priviledge} which our LORD has granted us, {To Observe} the LORDS-DAY; and let the Observation be thus carried on.

17.1.E First. On the LORDS-DAY, there must be a {Cessation} from {All Works}, but those of the Lord; and as for those {Works}, O Christians, you shall {Abound in them as much as ever you can.}

17.2.E The Thing that first set a Signature upon a {Sabbath}, was, That the Lord thereon {Rested} and {Ceased} from the Greatest {Works} of His Hands.

17.3.E Our {Sabbatizing} must very much Ly, in a {Conformity} to the Lord, and an {Imitation} of Him, and His {Resting} on the Day, now perpetually recurring in its period.

17.4.E We don't Observe the {Lords-Day}, if we don't observe a Sacred {Rest} upon the Day.

17.5.E We are advised, Isa. 56.2. {Blessed is the man who keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it}.

17.6.E There are things that will {pollute} the {Lords-day}; and we must {Avoid} those things, if we would {observe} the {Day}.

17.7.E But what things are those?

17.8.E Truly, those {Works}, which are forbidden for this Day of God, will be {polluting} to it; and such {Works}, as, alas, all the rest of the Week, we shall be concerned withal.

17.9.E More plainly; Be sure, All those Tedious, Toilsome, Heavy {Labours}, to which the {Curse} of God has doom'd Fallen man, are unseasonable on the {Lords-day}.

17.10.E The {Lords-day} is to mind us of our Deliverance from the {Curse}; and all the Reason in the world, will say, those Labours which are the effects of the {Curse}, are most properly, as far as ever 'tis possible, to be Laid aside on such a day.

17.11.E In brief, All {Works} which will divert us from that Religion, which is, {The Work of the Day}, are unlawful upon the {day}.

17.12.E As it was said unto {Gehazi}, {Is this a time to receive Money?}

17.13.E Even so I may say, {Is this a time to be meddling with our Civil Affairs?} Far from it.

18.1.E {Manna} itself, we may not this Day, go forth to gather it.

18.2.E Indeed, there are some {Works} of {Necessity} and of {Compassion}, which are consistent with the {Sacred Rest} of the {Lords-day}.

18.3.E On the {Lords-day} we are to {Eat}, and to {Drink} moderately, and have a moderate provision made for our {Tables}.

18.4.E 'Tis an Error, to turn the {Lords-day} into a {Fast day}.

18.5.E On the {Lords-day}, we may Defend our selves against our Enemies, and our Estates from sudden and grievous Desolations: We may Relieve the {Poor}, and Visit the {Sick}, and Feed our {Cattel}, and the like. [See Mat. 12. 1, 2, 3. and Luk. 13. 14, 15, 16]

18.6.E But the Business of our {personal} and {secular} Callings must not be followed on the {Lords-day}.

18.7.E To {Buy} and to {Sell}, to {Plant} and {Reap}, To bury our selves in the {Earth}, on the Day that our Lord Rose out of the {Earth}, Oh! there is not under Heaven, a thing more unsuitable!

18.8.E We read concerning the Governour of Israel, [Neh. 13. 15, 16] When he saw {some treading Wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in Sheaves, and Lading of Asses, and Selling of Victuals; and others that broguht Fish and all manner of Ware, and Sold on the Sabbath,} He {said unto them, What Evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath-day}.

18.9.E But if our {Labours} are prohibited on the {Lords-day}, methinks our {Pleasures} must be so too.

18.10.E It was no mistake in {Austin}, That it were better to {Plough}, than to {Dance} on the {Lords-day}.

18.11.E 'Tis {Gods Time}, and will not admit any {Pastime}.

18.12.E {Sports on the Lords-day[!]} Never did any thing sound more sorrowfully or more odiously since the day that the World was first bless'd with such a day.

19.1.E It is Enjoined upon us, Isa. 58. 13. {Turn away thy Foot from the Sabbath,} [take no long and hard Journeys upon it,] {from doing thy pleasure on my Holy Day; --- not finding thine own pleasure upon it.}

19.2.E And if {Our own Works}, are to be chased away from the {Lords-day}, how much more must those be so, that are peculiarly, {The Works of the Devil}?

19.3.E What would be a {Sin} on any Day of the Week, will on the {Lords-day} be a most {Aggravated Sin}.

19.4.E It would be a fearful Aggravation of wickedness in any man, on the {Lords-day} to {do wickedly}.

19.5.E Truly, The {Better the day}, the worse the {deed}!

19.6.E The wrath of the Almighty dreadfully Thundred upon it, when He could charge crimes on the people, with this bloody circumstance, Ezek. 23. 39. {They were on the same day, that they came into my Sanctuary}.

19.7.E Shall I carry this point a little further?

19.8.E Not only our own {Works}, but also our own {Words}, yea, and our own {Thoughts}, must on the {Lords-day} be {Rested} from.

19.9.E It was required, Isa. 58. 13. {On the Sabbath thou shalt not do thine own ways, nor speak thine own words.}

19.10.E On the {Lords-day}, we deserve a {Scourge}, if we don't{keep our mouth with a Bridle}, from speaking of {Impertinencies}.

19.11.E On the {Lords-day} we do not {Wash our Hearts from wickedness}, if we suffer {Vain Thoughts to lodge within them}.

19.12.E One thing more; Did I say, That we {Sin}, if we don't {Rest} on the {Lords-Day}? I did say so.

19.13.E And yet I will add; It will be a {Sin} for us to {Rest}: That is to say, To {Rest} from the Diligent Service of our Lord.

19.14.E Mark what I say; The {Lords-Day} is as often polluted by {Idleness}, as by any sort of {Profaneness}.

20.1.E We never do more {Amiss}, than when we do {Nothing} at all.

20.2.E By {Sins of Omission}; By {Sleeping immoderately}; by {Walking} only to take the Air; by Leaving undone, what we ought to do, we pollute the {Sabbaths} of the Lord.

20.3.E The truest {Rest} is that, whereof we read, Rev. 4. 8. {They Rest not Day and Night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty.}

20.4.E God forbid, That on the {Lords-day}, which is the Symbol of that {Rest}, we should by slothfulness {Rest} from those things, which may keep the day {Holy}, to the {most Holy Lord God Almighty!}
¶
20.5.E This presently transfers us to a Second Admonition.
¶
20.6.E Secondly; On the LORDS DAY, we must be entirely Devoted unto the {Service of the Lord}.

20.7.E Let the {Lords-Day} be filled with such Exercises of Piety and Charity, and {Holiness}, as will keep it {Holy}.

20.8.E {Sabbath-Dayes} must be filled with {Sabbath-Duties}.

20.9.E What if I should now summe up the Counsils, in the words of {Origen}?

20.10.E {If thou Ceasest from all thy secular works; and doest no worldly thing, but attendest on Spiritual Works, goest to the Church, and hearest Godly Lectures and Treatises, lookest not after present and visible things, but at invisible and futu[r]e, THIS is the Observation of the Christian Sabbath}.

20.11.E But since we must have some Time for our {Diet}, our {Dressing}, and {Repose}, how much Time on the {Lords-day}, are we to spend in {Religious Exercises}?

20.12.E Truly, As much Time as ever we can Redeem from those little {Circumstantials} of our Life;

21.1.E and as much Time at least, as we take on a {Week Day}, for our Worldly Concerns; and, in short, as much as we are able.

21.2.E I will chuse to propose it, under the Advantage of an Example given by an Excellent person, who is now gone to his {Everlasting Sabbath}; He would say, {Every Minute of Sabbath Time is precious, there should none of it be Lost!}

21.3.E And he thought, the {Lords day} scarce well spent, if he were not {weary} at Night, {weary}, not {of} the Duties, but {with} them: which Duties being finished, he would Lay down his {weary} head, and say, {Well, If this be not the way to Heaven, I don't know what is}.
¶
21.4.E Well; But what are the {Exercises} which the {Lords-Day} is to be laboriously filled withal?
¶
21.5.E First; {Heart-melting Meditations} on the {Words} and {Works} of God, and especially on those points whereto the {Lords-Day} has a special Reference.

21.6.E These cannot but be on the {Lords-Day} most Highly Seasonable.

21.7.E Yea, be sure that our {First Thoughts} when we Wake on the {Lords-day morning}, be fixed upon the Lord.

21.8.E And let {Heavenly Thoughts}, make a very Heaven of thy Heart, O Christian, and keep thee in {the Fear of the Lord all the Day long}.
