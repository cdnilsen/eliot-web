1.1.E BLessed be the {Lord} for such a {Day!}


1.2.E And Blessed are we of the {Lord}, that once in every Week, we are called unto the Observation of the {Day}.


1.3.E O Glorious {Day}!


1.4.E To which all other Days may confess, {Thou art worth ten thousand of us!}


1.5.E A {Day}, that is fairer than all the Children of Time: {The Lord is with thee; Blessed art thou among the Days.}


1.6.E The {Day}, which the {King of} Heaven {Delights to Honor}: and on which He chooses to open His Heavenly Treasures for the poor Children of men.

1.7.E The Day which is a very {map of Heaven}, and the {Day-break} of our Heavenly and Eternal Blessedness.


1.8.E The usual {Birthday} for the Sons of God.


1.9.E It is a {Day} set apart for to maintain the {Religion} of our Lord JESUS CHRIST in the World.


1.10.E That Holy {Religion} either Flourishes or Languishes, according to the Respect which this day meets withal.


1.11.E The {Commandment} which enjoyns the Observation of this {Day}, is more than ordinarily Expressive: 


2.1.E And the place where it stands between the {Two Tables} of the Law intimates an Extraordinary Influence, which the Keeping of it, would have upon our Keeping of {Both Tables}.


2.2.E It may be a Good Service unto {Religion}, to make the LORDS-DAY, the Subject of a brief Discourse among this People of the Lord.

2.3.E And with what can such a Discourse be better introduced, than that Oracle of God, which determines, {whose} the {Day} is, & {which} it is?

2.4.E Tis done by the Apostle {John}, declaring the {Day} of the {Week}, whereon the {Spirit of God} mightily took {Possession} of him, & gave him a Vision of what was to befall the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, from the Time of His {going away}, to the Time of His {coming again.}

2.5.E It is madness to think, That the Apostle does not mean a {Particular day of the Week}, by that which he calls, {The Lords Day}; there would not have been any USe, or any Sense, in going to tell the {day} of his Vision, with such a Term, if it must not have so been understood.

2.6.E There are two points of much Improtance unto our Holy Religion, which now at once become Incontestable.
¶

2.7.E First. It is plain, That there is {One Day in the Week}, that is, peculiarly to be acknowledged as, The LORDS-DAY.


2.8.E A {Day}, wherein the LORD JESUS CHRIST has a peculiar Propriety; A {Day}, which the LORD has claimed by a Divine {Institution}, for {His Own}; A {Day}, which is to be observed by us, as {Holy} unto the LORD; and accordingly to be Dedicated and Consecrated unto {Religious Purposes}
¶

2.9.E And, Secondly. It is plain, That the LORDS-DAY, is that very {Day of the Week}, which is now generally observed among the Faithful.


2.10.E But how does this appear?

3.1.E It appears from this, Because it can be No other Day. And it appears, from {Unquestionable Tradition}; the same {Unquestionable Tradition}, which assures us, that Η{μέρα κυριακὴ}, signifies {The Lords-Day}.


3.2.E We have as much Assurance, That what is here called, {The Lords day}, was the {First day} of the {Jewish Week}, as we can of any such matter; we can be sure of {Nothing} that is past, if we are not sure of {This}.


3.3.E We do most certainly know, That this was the {Name} of that very {Day}, and of none by {That}, in all the first Ages of Chrsitianity.


3.4.E We are certain, That {Clemens}, that {Justin Martyr}, that {Irenæus}, that {Origin}, that {Tertullian}, that whole Councils, and all Church History, have all along so taken it.


3.5.E Yea, we have in our Hands the Composures of {Ignatius}, written within Eight or Ten years of {John's} writing the {Revelation}, which tell us, That the Day called, {The} LORDS DAY, was the Day of our {Lords Rising from the Dead}; 

3.6.E and that they who would not Live in {Judaism}, should observe {this day}, and not the day before it, as Holy unto the Lord.


3.7.E {Pliny}, a Pagan Governour, in a Letter to {Tra[g]an}, the Emperour, in whose Reign the Apostle {John} died, reports, That the Christians then had a {stated day} in which they still met for the Praising of CHRIST.


3.8.E And we all know, That it was {This very day.}
¶

3.9.E Let us then without any Disputation, pass on to two indisputable {Propositions}.
¶

4.1.E The First PROPOSITION.


4.2.E There is a {Day} in the {Weekly Revolution}, which is to be observed by the People of God, as the {Lords-Day}, and a {Sabbath} to the Lord.


4.3.E In every {Week} of {Time}, there does revur one {Day} of {Time}, which we are bound for to keep {Holy} unto the Great {Lord of Time}.


4.4.E This Faith will be rendred Impregnable by this proof.


4.5.E The God of Heaven, did at the very Beginning of the World, set apart a {Seventh Day of Time}, to be kept {Holy} unto Himself.


4.6.E It may be, the word, {Remember}, at the Beginning of the Fourth Commandment, may invite us to look back unto the first Appointment of the {Sabbath}, at the Beginning of the World.


4.7.E For, Can any thing be more positive, than what we read? {Gen.} 2 2,3 {On the Seventh Day God Ended His Work which He had made, and He Rested on the Seventh Day, from all His Work which He had made; And God blessed the Seventh day, and Sanctified it}.


4.8.E What was the {Resting of God} on the {Seventh day}?


4.9.E There was no occasion for the old Heathen to scoff and jeer at the EXpression; flouting at the {Sabbath}, as,----- {Delassati mollis Imago Dei}.


4.10.E No; The {Resting of God}, was His not only {Ceasing} from the {Work}, which He had for {six days} together been carrying on, but also taking {Satisfaction} in the {Work} which had been so far carried on.


4.11.E For a Commemoration hereof, {God blessed the Seventh day,}


4.12.E That is, as it follows, {He Sanctified it.}


4.13.E And, what can this mean, but that He Enjoined the {Keeping} of it by us, as {Holy} unto Himself; He required, that we should {Sanctify} it, or Separate it for Sacred Uses.


5.1.E It is impossible to give any other tolerable Interpretation.


5.2.E Well; But when was the {Seventh day} so {Sanctified}?


5.3.E It was as Early as man could well be capable of being informed, that so it was.


5.4.E To say, That God {Sanctified the Seventh day} from the Beginning, even {from the Foundation of the World}; [Heb. 4. 4] only be determining that it should four and twenty Hundred years afterwards be kept by one Little People in the Land of {Judea}, methinks 'tis a very rude and harsh Anticipation.


5.5.E It is a Fancy of some, that the Command for an {Holy Sabbath}, was of no ancienter a Date, than the Station of {Israel}, at {Mara} in the Wilderness; But the Patrons of that Fancy do quickly run themselves into a greater Wilderness, than that wherein they suppose the {Sabbath} to have had its Original.


5.6.E Yea, when {Moses} demanded for his people, Exod. 3. 18. {That they might go into the Wilderness, to Sacrifice unto the Lord their God}; his Demand was, That they might go and keep an undisturbed {Sabbath} unto the Lord; For the {Sabbath} was the {Day of Sacrifices}.


5.7.E As 'tis confessed by all, that an {Holy Sabbath} every Week was observed by the Jews of Old; and the Jewish Rabbins confess, That {Abraham} also kept the {Holy Sabbath}; So there is cause to think, that the Saints of God, before the {Flood}, Glorified Him with an {Holy Sabbath} every Week.


5.8.E And that, as {Paræus} Expresses it, {The Sanctification of the Sabbath was observed in the Patriarchal Families}.


5.9.E Yeah, when we read of {Cain} and {Abel} Gen. 4. 3. {At the End of Days}, they brought their Offerings unto the Lord, 

5.10.E it means doubtless, That on the {Sabbath day} they brought their Offerings.

6.1.E And the Repeated Observation of a {Seventh day}, in the Time of the {Flood}, hath made Learned men conjecture, That in the {Ark} too, the Keeping of an {Holy Sabbath}, was not shut out of Doors.
¶

6.2.E A Quæstion.
¶

6.3.E {But why was the Sabbath Instituted?}
¶

6.4.E Let it not seem strange unto my Hearers, if I propose these {Christian Thoughts} unto them.
¶

6.5.E First; In the Appointment of the {Holy Sabbath}, from the Beginning, there was a special Regard unto our {Lord-Messiah}; and not only the Work of {Creation}, but also the Work of {Redemption}, was regarded in the Appointment.


6.6.E Most Reasonably it is said, {Mar.} 2. 28. {The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.}


6.7.E The {Sabbath} has a special Respect unto the {Son of Man}; and I make no stick to say, {It always} had so.


6.8.E There is abundance of cause to think, That the {Fall} of Man was before the {First Sabbath}; on the {Sixth Day}, even on the Day whereon man was made, he {Fell}.


6.9.E We are told, Psal. 49 12. {Man continued not a Night in his Excellence; He fell under Dominion, like the Beasts that perish}:


6.10.E Before {Night}, Satan obtained an horrible {Dominion} over him.


6.11.E The Arrival of the {First Sabbath} comforted {Fallen Man}, (as the Excellent {Alting}, the younger, observes,) with the Joyful Tidings of a {Redeemer}, to Rescue him from the Confusions which the {Old Serpent} had brought upon him.


6.12.E The {Sabbath} is to Celebrate the {Perfection} of the {Creation}, and the {Pleasure} which the Almighty took in perfecting the {Works} of His Hands.


6.13.E Yea, but the {Works} of God, were wofully defaced by the {Sin} of man, presently committed upon them.


7.1.E There must be a {Renovation} and a {Restitution} of these {Works} by our Lord-Redeemer, for the {perfecting} of them; they are not {perfected} without and until our Lord-Redeemers undertaking to Save all from Desolation, and {make all things New}.


7.2.E Wherefore the {Sabbath} was to Celebrate, not only the State, wherein the {Works of Creation} were before the Fall of man, but also to Celebrate the Wonderful Provision which God made upon the Fall of man, to Rescue the {Works of Creation} from Ruine, and Raise them to an higher {perfection} than ever, in the {Works of Redemption}.


7.3.E It was for a Celebration of what our {Lord-Messiah} has undertaken to do for the World, that an {Holy Sabbath} was at the Beginning Instituted.
¶

7.4.E Secondly; the {End} of the Blessed God, in Appointing an {Holy Sabbath}, from the Beginning of the World, was herewithal to {prepare} Fallen man, for the Blessedness of another and a better World.


7.5.E We are advised, Heb. 4 9. {There doth Remain a Rest for the People of God.}


7.6.E There is a {Blessedness} prepared for the people of the {Lord-Messiah} from the {Foundation of the World}.


7.7.E That {Blessedness} will be a {Rest} from all that is uneasy to us;


7.8.E a {Rest} from all the vanities and vexations of this {present Evil World}; a {Rest} in the full Enjoyment of God, becoming {All} in {All} into us.


7.9.E And it is no empty Notion, That the {Seventh period}, the {Seventh Chiliad} of the World, will bring on that {Rest} of God.


7.10.E Now, the {Holy Sabbath}, as 'tis a {Sign} of our Title to that {Eternal Sabbatism}, wherein the {Blessed} shall {Rest from their Labours}:


8.1.E They who keep it, have the {Eternal Blessedness} of the Heavenly World therein {Seal'd} unto them: So, 'tis a notable {Mean} to fit us for our {Blessed Rest}.


8.2.E If man had not Sinn'd, Every Day of the Week, would have been more like a {Sabbath}; but since our Sin has plung'd us into so many Cares of this World, it is highly necessary for us to be accommodated with {One Day in Seven}, for to Lay aside our Worldly Cares, and be wholly taken up in Fellowship with God, and in those things, which are to fit us four our {Eternal Blessedness}.
¶

8.3.E The Second PROPOSITION.
¶

8.4.E 'Tis fit that the Great God should Appoint, {which day} in the {Weekly Revolution} He will have to be observed as our {Holy Sabbath}; and He does now Appoint the {Day} of the Week, whereon our {Lord Rose} from the Dead.


8.5.E Our {Fourth Commandment} speaks only of {One day in seven}, to be kept as a {Sabbath day}.


8.6.E And the Holy {Spirit of God} hath signified unto the People of God, {which day of the seven}, He hath pitched upon.

8.7.E That which was the {Sabbath-day} under the {Old Testament}, was the same that has been thought generally to have been the {Seventh-day} from the {Creation}.

8.8.E And 'tis clear, that the {Day} following it, is by the Direction of the Holy Spirit, now become our {Holy Sabbath}; even the Day of our {Lords Resurrection from the Dead}.

8.9.E Our Lord Lying in His Grave, all the {Old Sabbath}, has left that {Old Sabbath} buried there.

8.10.E And some have remarked a curious Agreeableness, in the Translation of the {Sabbath} from the {Last day} of the Week, to the {First}.

9.1.E The {Jewish Sabbath}, had a little strain of the {Old Covenant} in it; First the {Working days}, and then the Promise of {Rest} and {Life}.

9.2.E But the {Christian Sabbath} has a greater strain of the {New-Covenant} in it; which first gives the Believer the Promise of {Rest} and {Peace}; before he does the {Works of Righteousness}.
¶
9.3.E This is very sure; There appears no Day so suitable for our {Holy Sabbath}, as the Day whereon our Lord-Redeemer, {Finishing} His Work of Redemption {Triumphed} over the Enemies and Hindrances of our Salvation.

9.4.E It is required, (for so 'tis to be rendered,) Isa. 58. 13. {Thou shalt call the Sabbath a Delight}, (i.e. Keep it as a Day of Holy Delight,) {unto the Holy one of the Lord, the Glorified} (or Victorious) {One}.

9.5.E It is our Lord Jesus Christ, who is, {The Holy One of God}.

9.6.E It was on the {Day} of his {Resurrection}, that our Lord was {Glorified} and Victorious.

9.7.E The {Sabbath} being a Day for us to {Delight} in the {Holy One}, and in his {Victories}, what {Fitter day} can we have to be our {Sabbath-Day}, than the {Day of His Victories}?

9.8.E Had we been left unto our own Conduct, what fitter Day could we have chosen for our {Sabbath}, than a Day so Ennobled?

9.9.E {Samuel} argued for {Souls} being chosen, because there was {none like him}, a man higher than the rest of the People.

9.10.E Truly, This Day is advanced by our Lords {Resurrection} upon it, and made much Taller than any of the Seven, Why should we not say, {Behold, the Day which the Lord has chosen}!

10.1.E It was therefore foretold in the {Old-Testament}, That the Day of our {Lords Resurrection} would be the {Holy Sabbath} of His People.

10.2.E We read, Psal. 110 3 {Thy People shall} be a People of {Free-will-Offerings, in the Day of thy Power}.

10.3.E The Day of our {Lords Resurrection} from the Dead, was eminently the {Day of His Power}: He was, {Declared the Son of God with Power}, by the {Resurrection from the Dead}.

10.4.E Well, and this is to be the Day for His People to bring their {Free-will-Offerings} unto Him.----Compare, Psal. 118. 24.

10.5.E And the Singular Honour then sometimes put upon the {Eighth Day}, (the Day after the {Seventh}, seems to have carried in it, a prediction of our {Christian Sabbath}.
¶
10.6.E But that which may procure an Everlasting {Rest} unto the {Sabbatarian Controversy}, is this; and there needs no more: 'Tis the {Lords-Day!}

10.7.E That's enough to prove, that is by the Institution of Heaven, to be kept {Holy} unto the LORD.
¶
10.8.E We may add; The {Day} which both the {Præcept} and the {Pattern} of the Holy Apostles, have commended unto us for our {Holy Sabbath}, is the Day for it Commanded by our Lord Himself.

10.9.E But such is the Day, which we now observe as the LORDS DAY.

10.10.E {Baronius} with very good Reason sayes, "That all who are in their Witts, will say, that since it is found, that the LORDS DAY was observed in the Apostles Times, it could not be ordained and Commanded to be kept of any other but of themselves."

10.11.E And you know the Consequence!

10.12.E 'Tis well judged by {Tertullian}; "The Apostles chose nothing which they brought in at their own pleasure, but faithfully appointed unto the Nations the Discipline which they received from Christ."

11.1.E Indeed, tho' the {Resurrection of our Lord} had Consigned over unto this Day of ours, all the Rights of the {Holy Sabbath}, yet it is probable, the Day was not compleatly advanced into the practise of the Faithful, until the Day of {Pentecost}, which was not until {Seven times seven} Days after it.

11.2.E Our Lord Jesus Christ had, its true, several Times put a singular Honour on this Day, by His chusing to Exhibit Himself unto his Disciples upon it.

11.3.E But when the Advancement of our Lord Jesus Christ was Consummated, in {Sitting at the Right hand of God}, He poured out His {Holy Spirit} on His Apostles.

11.4.E That pouring out of the {Holy Spirit}, which Revealed the whole will of God unto them, was on {that very day}.

11.5.E And from {that very day}, we find the Apostles distinguishing the {Day} as {Holy} unto the Lord.
¶
11.6.E They distinguish'd it by their {Precept}: 1 Cor 16. 2. {Upon the First Day of the Week, Let every one of you lay by him in store.}

11.7.E Why should the {First day of the week} be preferr'd before any other Day, for the Faithful to Assemble unto the {Service of the Lord}:

11.8.E There can be no Reason given, but because it is the {Sabbath of the Lord}.
¶
11.9.E They distinguish'd it by their {Pattern}: Acts 20. 7. {Upon the First day of the week, the Disciples came together and} Paul {Preached unto them}.

11.10.E Why should the {First day of the Week} be the only Day in {Seven} (for so long had {Paul} been there,) for the Disciples to {Come together}?

11.11.E There can be no Reason given, but because it was become the {Sabbath} unto them.

11.12.E In short, We are arm'd with Confessions from the greatest Adversaries of the {Sabbath}, "That the Observation of the {Lords Day}, was received by the common consent of all the Churches in the World, even from and in the Apostles Days, and this with the Approbation and Authority of the Apostles themselves."

12.1.E Now the Apostles directed the Churches to nothing, but what they had a Commission from the Lord Jesus Christ, and a Direction from His Holy Spirit for.

¶

12.2.E In fine; If the {Jewish Sabbath} be abrogated, then some {other day} must be kept, as the {Christian Sabbath}.

12.3.E But no {other day} pretends to be so, besides the Day now kept among the Faithful.

12.4.E The Abrogation of the {Jewish Sabbath}, is very peremptory; Col. 2 16. {Let no man Judge you, in respect of the Sabbath-days.}

12.5.E The {Weekly Sabbath-days} observed among the Jews, must be the only Things intended, when it is said. {Let no man judge you in respect of them}; That is, let no man go to Impose them upon you, or {Judge} that you Sin, if you do not keep them.

12.6.E Some {Sabbath} must be kept; The {Jewish Sabbath} mayn't be kept; It remains, that our {Christian Sabbath} take the place of it.
¶
12.7.E APPLICATION.
¶
12.8.E But shall we then, O Christians, Apply our selves unto the most Religious Observation of the {Lords-day}? This is the point that is to be this Day managed in the Publick Exhortations.

12.9.E The point, and the CASE now before us, is,
¶
12.10.E {How is the} LORDS-DAY, {to be Observed by the People of the Lord}?
¶
12.11.E Our Lord said with an Eye to this very Day, Joh. 8. 56. {Abraham rejoyced to see my day, he saw it & was glad.}

12.12.E He saw it, when He saw his {Isaac} Raised from the Dead.

13.1.E How much more may we Rejoyce, O Christians?

13.2.E We {see} the {Day} of our Lord every Week.

13.3.E Don't we {see} it {Joyfully}?

13.4.E I hope we do.

13.5.E But God grant, that we may {see} it {Holily} too, {see} it {Watchfully}, and {see} it {Fruitfully}.

13.6.E In the primitive Times, it was the very {Character}, by which the Christians were discovered. {A Conscientious Observation of the} LORDS DAY.

13.7.E If one of them had it asked of him; {Servasti Dominicum}? Have you kept the LORDS DAY?

13.8.E He would answer, {Christianus sum, Intermittere non possum}: I am a Christian, and I dare to do no other.

13.9.E {Christians}, I am now to Exhort you, That you would Retain and Maintain your {Character}. ¶ But,

13.10.E {I.} I cannot proceed so hopefully as I Desire, to recommend the Observation of the LORDS DAY, till I have prevail'd with my Hearers, to call it by its true Christian Name, of THE LORDS DAY, (or, The {Sabbath}, which is also a Scripture, and a proper Name for i[t]:) and not Forget and Affront Christianity, by calling it SUN-DAY, as too many too often do.

13.11.E I must assure you, To keep up the {Right Names} of Things in matters of Religion, has no little Tendency to keep up {Right Thoughts} of the Things themselves.

13.12.E Wise men have sometimes been justly apprehensive, of more mischief lurking in {Bare Names}, than is commonly apprehended by those that use them.

13.13.E I remember an unhappy passge of the {Romish} and {Rhemish} Annotators upon the New-Testament; say they, concerning the Protestants, {While they say} Ministers, {let us say}, Priests; {when they call it}, A Communion Table, {let us call it}, An Altar.

14.1.E {Let us keep our old Words, and we shall keep our old Things}.

14.2.E Truly, Sirs; you are much in the Right on't!

14.3.E But what will you say, When I tell you, That the {Rhemish} Annotators themselves, [on Rev. 1. 10.] condemn the Name of {Sunday} as Heathenish?

14.4.E I will not quote unto you the complaints even of no better a man than {Polydore Virgil}, about our keeping up the {Planetary Names} for the {Days}.

14.5.E I will only say, every Body knows, that the {Pagans} were they, who first called this Day, by the Name of {Sunday}; and that it was a stroke of their {Idolatry} to call it so, that is to say, 'twas to Express the Dedication of the Day unto the Oldest and Brightest {Idol} in the World.

14.6.E If any of those {Pagans}, might now give their {Balaamitick} Advice, how to make People insensible of the Reverence due to, {The} LORDS DAY, they would say, By all means keep up our {Idolatrous Name} for the Day, and never let it be call'd any other than, {Sunday}.

14.7.E But Sirs, if it be, The LORDS DAY, let us not be shy of honestly calling it so!

14.8.E Surely, we are not ashamed of confessing our LORD, or of confessing that This Day belongs unto Him.

14.9.E We may before we are aware, {Take the Lords Name in Vain}, by not allowing to the {LORDS DAY}, the {Name} which He has Himself challenged for it: 

14.10.E The {Third} and the {Fourth} Commandments may be together violated, in our denying the {Name} of the LORD, unto the {Day} of the LORD.

15.1.E Have any of my Hearers, a secret Inclination to bring or keep the LORDS DAY under {Contempt}?

15.2.E {Beloved, we are perswaded better things of you!}

15.3.E But would not the Royal Person who is now placed at the Head of Three mighty Kingdoms, count it a contempt of Her Majesty, if People should now call Her nothing but, {The Princess of Denmark}?

15.4.E And I am the more free in making use of this comparison, because the Jews do very agreeably call the {Sabbath-day}, by that Name, {The Queen of all the Dayes}: 

15.5.E And {Ignatius} puts upon the {Lords-day} too, that very Title.

15.6.E It is true, some of the Ancients, as both {Justin Martyr} and {Tertullian}, do sometimes, in their {Apologies}, call the {Lords-day}, by the Name of, {Sunday}; But there is this to be {Apologised} for them, That they directed their Apologies unto the {Pagans}, who would not have readily understood another Name.

15.7.E And now that you may not count me {more Nice than Wise}, I will quote you a few more of the Ancients, to whom, if you please, the matter shall be referr'd.

15.8.E First, the great {Ambrose} has a Passage of this Import, {The Day which is called,} The Lords day {in the Church, is called} Sunday, {by the men of the World}.

15.9.E And then, the greater {Austin}, shows, that the {Manichees} rather than the {Christians} called, {The Lords day}, by the Name of {Sunday}; but, says he, {For our parts, we call it the} Lords day, {because on it, we reverence not the Sun, but the Resurrection of the Lord.}

15.10.E And elsewhere, he is very earnest, for that {Heathen-Name} to be laid aside: says he, {'Tis a manner of speaking, that becomes not a Christian Mouth.} Add hereto, That {Philastrius} would have the use of this Name with Christians reckoned little short of {Hæretical}.

16.1.E If my Hearers don't Relish, what I have now said, they may go quarrel with the Ashes of those Venerable Fathers. 

16.2.E I have done with it!
¶
16.3.E {II.} From the {Name}, Let us come to the {Thing}.

16.4.E Since we {Enjoy}, The LORDS DAY, Let us {Employ} it as the {Lords-Day}, and keep it {Holy}, and give it {Wholly}, unto the LORD.

16.5.E Christians, 'Tis no little Favour of our Lord unto us, that He has {Appointed} One Day in Seven for a Religious Observation with us, and that He has {Acquainted} us with His Appointment.

16.6.E {Ah, Lord, In Twenty years Time, thou hast given me more than One Thousand Sabbaths}; But therein, more than {Ten Thousand Mercies}.

16.7.E It is mention'd as a Signal Favour, to the Ancient People of God, Neh. 9. 14. {Lord, Thou madest known unto them, thy Holy Sabbath}.

16.8.E Truly, there is no {Sabbath-breaker}, but what is chargeable with an {Hyperboly} of {Ingratitude!}

16.9.E Certainly, we are {Lifted up to Heaven,} when our Lord allows us, yea, Invites us, yea, Commands us, to Spend one Day of Seven, in the very {Suburbs of Heaven}, above all Earthly Avocations.

16.10.E If this {Commandment be Grievous} unto us, where is the {Love} to our Lord Jesus Christ, or to our own Souls, and how monstrous is our Ingratitude?

16.11.E Come, Let us with all possible Thankfulness and Chearfulness, accept the {Priviledge} which our LORD has granted us, {To Observe} the LORDS-DAY; and let the Observation be thus carried on.
¶
17.1.E First. On the LORDS-DAY, there must be a {Cessation} from {All Works}, but those of the Lord; and as for those {Works}, O Christians, you shall {Abound in them as much as ever you can.}

17.2.E The Thing that first set a Signature upon a {Sabbath}, was, That the Lord thereon {Rested} and {Ceased} from the Greatest {Works} of His Hands.

17.3.E Our {Sabbatizing} must very much Ly, in a {Conformity} to the Lord, and an {Imitation} of Him, and His {Resting} on the Day, now perpetually recurring in its period.

17.4.E We don't Observe the {Lords-Day}, if we don't observe a Sacred {Rest} upon the Day.

17.5.E We are advised, Isa. 56.2. {Blessed is the man who keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it}.

17.6.E There are things that will {pollute} the {Lords-day}; and we must {Avoid} those things, if we would {observe} the {Day}.

17.7.E But what things are those?

17.8.E Truly, those {Works}, which are forbidden for this Day of God, will be {polluting} to it; and such {Works}, as, alas, all the rest of the Week, we shall be concerned withal.

17.9.E More plainly; Be sure, All those Tedious, Toilsome, Heavy {Labours}, to which the {Curse} of God has doom'd Fallen man, are unseasonable on the {Lords-day}.

17.10.E The {Lords-day} is to mind us of our Deliverance from the {Curse}; and all the Reason in the world, will say, those Labours which are the effects of the {Curse}, are most properly, as far as ever 'tis possible, to be Laid aside on such a day.

17.11.E In brief, All {Works} which will divert us from that Religion, which is, {The Work of the Day}, are unlawful upon the {day}.

17.12.E As it was said unto {Gehazi}, {Is this a time to receive Money?}

17.13.E Even so I may say, {Is this a time to be meddling with our Civil Affairs?} Far from it.

18.1.E {Manna} itself, we may not this Day, go forth to gather it.

18.2.E Indeed, there are some {Works} of {Necessity} and of {Compassion}, which are consistent with the {Sacred Rest} of the {Lords-day}.

18.3.E On the {Lords-day} we are to {Eat}, and to {Drink} moderately, and have a moderate provision made for our {Tables}.

18.4.E 'Tis an Error, to turn the {Lords-day} into a {Fast day}.

18.5.E On the {Lords-day}, we may Defend our selves against our Enemies, and our Estates from sudden and grievous Desolations: We may Relieve the {Poor}, and Visit the {Sick}, and Feed our {Cattel}, and the like. [See Mat. 12. 1, 2, 3. and Luk. 13. 14, 15, 16]

18.6.E But the Business of our {personal} and {secular} Callings must not be followed on the {Lords-day}.

18.7.E To {Buy} and to {Sell}, to {Plant} and {Reap}, To bury our selves in the {Earth}, on the Day that our Lord Rose out of the {Earth}, Oh! there is not under Heaven, a thing more unsuitable!

18.8.E We read concerning the Governour of Israel, [Neh. 13. 15, 16] When he saw {some treading Wine-presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in Sheaves, and Lading of Asses, and Selling of Victuals; and others that broguht Fish and all manner of Ware, and Sold on the Sabbath,} He {said unto them, What Evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the Sabbath-day}.

18.9.E But if our {Labours} are prohibited on the {Lords-day}, methinks our {Pleasures} must be so too.

18.10.E It was no mistake in {Austin}, That it were better to {Plough}, than to {Dance} on the {Lords-day}.

18.11.E 'Tis {Gods Time}, and will not admit any {Pastime}.

18.12.E {Sports on the Lords-day!} 

18.13.E Never did any thing sound more sorrowfully or more odiously since the day that the World was first bless'd with such a day.

19.1.E It is Enjoined upon us, Isa. 58. 13. {Turn away thy Foot from the Sabbath,} [take no long and hard Journeys upon it,] {from doing thy pleasure on my Holy Day; --- not finding thine own pleasure upon it.}

19.2.E And if {Our own Works}, are to be chased away from the {Lords-day}, how much more must those be so, that are peculiarly, {The Works of the Devil}?

19.3.E What would be a {Sin} on any Day of the Week, will on the {Lords-day} be a most {Aggravated Sin}.

19.4.E It would be a fearful Aggravation of wickedness in any man, on the {Lords-day} to {do wickedly}.

19.5.E Truly, The {Better the day}, the worse the {deed}!

19.6.E The wrath of the Almighty dreadfully Thundred upon it, when He could charge crimes on the people, with this bloody circumstance, Ezek. 23. 39. {They were on the same day, that they came into my Sanctuary}.

19.7.E Shall I carry this point a little further?

19.8.E Not only our own {Works}, but also our own {Words}, yea, and our own {Thoughts}, must on the {Lords-day} be {Rested} from.

19.9.E It was required, Isa. 58. 13. {On the Sabbath thou shalt not do thine own ways, nor speak thine own words.}

19.10.E On the {Lords-day}, we deserve a {Scourge}, if we don't {keep our mouth with a Bridle}, from speaking of {Impertinencies}.

19.11.E On the {Lords-day} we do not {Wash our Hearts from wickedness}, if we suffer {Vain Thoughts to lodge within them}.

19.12.E One thing more; Did I say, That we {Sin}, if we don't {Rest} on the {Lords-Day}? I did say so.

19.13.E And yet I will add; It will be a {Sin} for us to {Rest}: That is to say, To {Rest} from the Diligent Service of our Lord.

19.14.E Mark what I say; The {Lords-Day} is as often polluted by {Idleness}, as by any sort of {Profaneness}.

20.1.E We never do more {Amiss}, than when we do {Nothing} at all.

20.2.E By {Sins of Omission}; By {Sleeping immoderately}; by {Walking} only to take the Air; by Leaving undone, what we ought to do, we pollute the {Sabbaths} of the Lord.

20.3.E The truest {Rest} is that, whereof we read, Rev. 4. 8. {They Rest not Day and Night, saying, Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty.}

20.4.E God forbid, That on the {Lords-day}, which is the Symbol of that {Rest}, we should by slothfulness {Rest} from those things, which may keep the day {Holy}, to the {most Holy Lord God Almighty!}
¶
20.5.E This presently transfers us to a Second Admonition.
¶
20.6.E Secondly; On the LORDS DAY, we must be entirely Devoted unto the {Service of the Lord}.

20.7.E Let the {Lords-Day} be filled with such Exercises of Piety and Charity, and {Holiness}, as will keep it {Holy}.

20.8.E {Sabbath-Dayes} must be filled with {Sabbath-Duties}.

20.9.E What if I should now summe up the Counsils, in the words of {Origen}?

20.10.E {If thou Ceasest from all thy secular works; and doest no worldly thing, but attendest on Spiritual Works, goest to the Church, and hearest Godly Lectures and Treatises, lookest not after present and visible things, but at invisible and futu[r]e, THIS is the Observation of the Christian Sabbath}.

20.11.E But since we must have some Time for our {Diet}, our {Dressing}, and {Repose}, how much Time on the {Lords-day}, are we to spend in {Religious Exercises}?

20.12.E Truly, As much Time as ever we can Redeem from those little {Circumstantials} of our Life;

21.1.E and as much Time at least, as we take on a {Week Day}, for our Worldly Concerns; and, in short, as much as we are able.

21.2.E I will chuse to propose it, under the Advantage of an Example given by an Excellent person, who is now gone to his {Everlasting Sabbath}; 

21.3.E He would say, {Every Minute of Sabbath Time is precious, there should none of it be Lost!}

21.4.E And he thought, the {Lords day} scarce well spent, if he were not {weary} at Night, {weary}, not {of} the Duties, but {with} them: 

21.5.E which Duties being finished, he would Lay down his {weary} head, and say, {Well, If this be not the way to Heaven, I don't know what is}.
¶
21.6.E Well; But what are the {Exercises} which the {Lords-Day} is to be laboriously filled withal?
¶
21.7.E First; {Heart-melting Meditations} on the {Words} and {Works} of God, and especially on those points whereto the {Lords-Day} has a special Reference.

21.8.E These cannot but be on the {Lords-Day} most Highly Seasonable.

21.9.E Yea, be sure that our {First Thoughts} when we Wake on the {Lords-day morning}, be fixed upon the Lord.

21.10.E And let {Heavenly Thoughts}, make a very Heaven of thy Heart, O Christian, and keep thee in {the Fear of the Lord all the Day long}.

21.11.E There is a Psalm in the Bible, whereof the Title is, {A Psalm} or {Song for the Sabbath Day}.

21.12.E Now 'tis a clause in that Psalm; Psal. 92. 5. {O Lord, How great are thy works; thy Thoughts are very deep}!

21.13.E That clause intimates, What we should make the Subject of our Meditations on the {Sabbath-Day}.

21.14.E Our {Thoughts} are to be on Gods {Works}, at such a Time.

21.15.E Syrs, On the {Lords-Day} let us lay our Blessed Bible before us; and be able to say, {O Lord, How I love they Law! It is my Meditation all the Day!}

22.1.E The whole {Body of Divinity}, is a Boundless Ocean, for our Midns on the {Lords-Day} to Sail over, with {Meditations}, and unspeakable {Consolations}.

22.2.E {Meditate} very much on the Great GOD, and on His {Perfections}, and on His {Providences}.

22.3.E {Meditate} very much on the Condition of our own Souls, and what {the Lord our God requires of us}.

22.4.E But especially {Meditate} on the points which the {Lords-Day} does peculiarly represent unto our minds.

22.5.E {Meditate} on the State of the World by {Creation}, and on the better State whereto the World is recovered by {Redemption}.

22.6.E {Meditate} on the Glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST; His Person, His Natures, His Offices, His Actions, His Benefits, and His Excellencies, and that astonishing Operation of His, which was on {this Day} accomplished: 

22.7.E {Meditate} on the Blessedness of the Life to come, whereto our Lord JESUS CHRIST will at last bring all His Chosen People, and whereof {this Day} is a sweet Præfiguration.

22.8.E The Primitive Christians, when they met one another on the {Lords-Day}, they ordinarily made this their first Saltutation, 

22.9.E {Sir, Our Lord is Risen}; 

22.10.E Oh! we should on the {Lords-Day} have our Thoughts mightily taken up with the {Resurrection} of our Lord JESUS CHRIST; and the Felicity whereto He will bring us at the {Resurrection} from the Dead.

22.11.E And by these Thoughts, we should have our Hearts mightily {Raised} unto the Loving and Praising of our Great Lord Redeemer, and longing to be with Him.

22.12.E When the {Lords-day} arrives, What shall we say, but, {Welcome, Welcome, O Day greatly Beloved!}

22.13.E {Now I know that my Redeemer Lives, and because He Lives, I shall also Live!}
¶
23.1.E Secondly. There are the Duties of {Private Worship}, wherewith we should on the {Lords Day}, be {Fervent in Spirit Serving the Lord}.

23.2.E Profane is the Negligence of those, who never {Pray in Secret}, except on the {Lords-Day}; but still more profanely Negligent are they who do it not so much as on the {Lords Day}.

23.3.E On the {Lords-Day} we should Retire for {Secret Prayer}; yea, why should we not be able to say with the Psalmist; Psal. 55 17 {Evening, and Morning, and at Noon will I pray!}

23.4.E But on the {Lords-Day} we should also call our {Families} together, for a {Morning and Evening Sacrifice}.

23.5.E {Family-Prayer} which is to be performed {Every Day}, is rather more to be performed on the {Lords-Day}.

23.6.E It is Expressly demanded of all {Masters} with their {Families}, that they should be, Col. 4.3 {Praying Together}: for so 'tis to be rendred. The {Reading of the Scripture} should accompany it.

23.7.E And the {Lords-Day} is a Day for us to {Instruct} our {Little Folks}, in the Things of the Lord.

23.8.E It is a {Day}, to {Catechise} them; it is a {Day} to {Examine} how their Souls are informed or affected; 

23.9.E it is a {Day} to inculcate the Lessons of God upon them, and especially such as have newly been dispensed in the Sermons.

23.10.E {As for the true Sons of Abraham, I know them, that they will on the} Lords-Day {so Instruct their Children and their Housholds}!

23.11.E and the Efficacy of their Instructions will abide upon them all their Dayes.
¶
23.12.E Thirdly. There are the {Duties} of {Publick Worship}, wherewith on the {Lords-Day}, we should {Praise the Lord in His Congregations}.

23.13.E Our Lord Himself of old by doing it Himself, taught us, {To Visit the Synagogue on the Sabbath day.}

23.14.E We find that Remark made upon the {Lords-Day}, Psal. 118. 24-26. {This is the Day which the Lord hath made, we will Rejoyce and be Glad in it: ----we have blessed you out of the House of the Lord.}

24.1.E Why, on the {Day of the Lord}, we should repair to the {House of the Lord}, that we may be made partakers of the {Blessing} which is in that {House} to be met withal: And {There the Lord Commands the Blessing, even Life for evermore.}

24.2.E On the {Lords-day}, we should joyn with our Neighbours, in Seeking the {Face} of the Lord, in Singing the {Praise} of the Lord, in Hearing the {Word} of the Lord, and in using all those means of Grace for which the {Good Neighbours} come together.

24.3.E And we should hardly own those for {Good Neighbours}, who decline the doing of it.

24.4.E Let me so Summon my Neighbours together, {O Come, let us Worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker}, on this Day of {Rest, lest He Swear in his Wrath, that we shall not enter into His Rest.}

24.5.E In the {Song for the Sabbath-day}, we find that Passage; Psal. 92. 13. {Those that are Planted in the House of the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts of our God.}

24.6.E Why, That should be our {Song on the Sabbath day}: {Oh! Let me now be planted in the House of the Lord, and as lothe to come out of it, as a Tree to be pull'd up by the Roots: Lord, The zeal of thy House, hath Eaten me up: A day in thy House is better than a thousand!}
¶
24.7.E But are we now ready for a Third Admonition?
¶
24.8.E Thirdly. 'Tis a thousand pities, that by the Dispute about {the Two Evenings} before and after the LORDS-DAY, the LORDS-DAY it self should suffer any {Injuries}.

24.9.E The {Lords-Day} has an {Evening} that belongs as a part of {Holy Time}, unto it.

24.10.E But Good men, and some very Godly Observers of the {Lords-Day}, are not agreed, which {Evening} is to be Observed, that which goes before, or that which comes after.

25.1.E And the corruption of many (who I suppose would count it as a very hard Law which was Enacted as long ago as K. {Edgars} Time in {England}, {That the Sabbath should begin on} Satureday {at three a Clock in the Afternoon, and continue till break of Day on} Monday:) takes occasion from this Disagreement, for to keep no {Evening} at all; 

25.2.E Yea, {between two neglected Evenings, the Lords-day falls to the Ground}.

25.3.E I will not here undertake to decide the Controversy; I will concede unto both Opinions, and yet you shall {Suffer me a little, and I will shew you, that I have yet to speak on Gods behalf}.
¶
25.4.E First, Those of you, my Brethren, that won't allow the {preceding Evening}, to be part of the {Sabbath}; altho' you cannot but confess, it was of old so: 

25.5.E Yet Sirs, You will allow that there should be, {A Preparation for the Sabbath}.

25.6.E It seems implied in that word, 

25.7.E {Remember the Sabbath day}; Be mindful of it, make Ready for it, Let it not surprize you {unprepared} for it.

25.6.E It was the Custome of the Jews, to begin that {preparation} at Three a Clock in the Afternoon.

25.7.E And shall we {Christians}, do nothing for {Preparation!}

25.8.E When the {Lords-Day} is coming, the Lord Himself is in some sort Coming; And, Wilt thou not {prepare to meet thy God}, O Christian?

25.9.E The Lord Jesus Christ calls to thee afore-hand, as to {Zacheus, Make haste, and come down, for this Day I must be with thee.}

25.10.E Dispose and Dispatch thy Encumbrances off thy Hand, yea, and off thy Mind also, as the {Lords-Day} is approaching.

25.11.E And be Engaged in suitable Devotions, on the {preceding Evening}.

26.1.E Certainly, Tis a proposal that cannot be Cavilled at!

26.2.E At least, the Renowned Churches of {Bohemia}, I am sure did not think it so, when they made and kept such strict Orders, about this {Evening}, as we know they did.

26.3.E People sometimes continue drowned in the Hurries of this World, after 'tis Dark, the Evening before the {Sabbath}.

26.4.E Ask 'em, and they'l tell you, {They have not yet begun the Sabbath}.

26.5.E Alas, man, at this rate, I am afraid, Thou {wilt never Begin a Sabbath at all.}

26.6.E But a more dreadful word than that, cannot be spoken!

¶

26.7.E Secondly; Those of you my Brethren, that won't allow the {Ensuing Evening} to be a part of the {Sabbath}; but suppose that the Stars of Heaven are hung out to proclaim unto us, a liberty to return unto the Things of Earth: 

26.8.E Yet, Syrs, you will allow that Serious Christians will be loth to let the Impressions of the {Sabnath}, wear off immediately.

26.9.E {It is a Lamentation, and should be for a Lamentation}, unto all the Friends of God, That there is more Sin against the Lord committed the {Ensuing Evening} after the {Lords-day}, then perhaps on any one Day of the Week beside,

26.10.E and that we so often then let our Children and our Servants run into so much {Temptation}.

26.11.E Christian, Why should we lose the {Heat} of the Day, (as one aptly Expresses) it, in the cool of the {Evening}?

26.12.E Why should we let useless Discourses, hurtful Distractions, carnal Excursions, in the {Evening}, Extinguish the Frame which the Devotions of the {Day} had Enkindled in us?

27.1.E Why should we not confine our selves to Savoury {Conferences}, if we must Salley forth to {Conferences}; and confine our Houses to a Regular Discipline, that the {Lords-day} may not be {buried} in its {Evenings}, and be {put out in obscure Darkness}?

27.2.E {Bells}, and {Saints}, of a good Metal, will keep the {Sounds}, when the {Strokes} are over.

27.3.E In brief, much of {Scandal} might be prevented if the Two Evenings were less Invaded. And less Invaded they would be, if our Delight in God were what it ought to be.

27.4.E Delight in God would make us on the Lords Day, even to say, if we could with {Joshua}, {Thou Sun, stand still!}

27.5.E Or to wish at least with a Jewish Rabbi, {Let my portion be to begin the Sabbath with those of} Tiberias, {who began it sooner than others}; {and to conclude it with those of} Tsepphore, {who continue it longer than others}.
¶
27.6.E But Fourthly; Why should not all that are in any {Authority} whatsoever, which they have received from the {Lord}, Exort their {Authority}, to Restrain the Violation of the {Lords-Day}?

27.7.E You know the Terms of the Commandment; {The Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it, thou shalt not do any work, nor thy Stranger that is within thy Gates.}

27.8.E Oh! Let us extend our Influences, that none {within our Gates}, may set open a {Door} for all Profanity, by profanation of the {Sabbath}.

27.9.E {Parents} may do much, {Masters} may do much, that our {Young People} may not {Sin} against the {Lords-Day}, and {wrong their own Souls.}

27.10.E And a more thorough Inspection upon the Lads, that {Play at Meeting}, would preserve the {Lords-day} from several Violations.

28.1.E But much may be done by the {Rulers} in the {Common-Wealth}, to obtain and secure the Good {Presence of God} among their People, by improving the {Sword of the Lord} in their Hands, to defend the {Day of the Lord} from sinful Encroachments upon it.

28.1.E {Rulers} in a {Superiour} Capacity, may do well to set before them the laudable Copy of the Renowned {Nehemiah}; who bore such Testimony against the {Disorders} which he saw growing upon the {Sabbath} in his Province, that at length he could joyfully say, Neh. 13 21, 22 {From that time forth, came they no more on the Sabbath}.

28.2.E But, {Remember, me, O my God, concerning it}.

28.3.E {Rulers} in an {Inferiour} Capacity may very much assist one another, in the Execution of our wholesome {Laws}, which Guard the {Sabbath}; and why may we not so address them? Ezra 10 4. {Arise, for this matter belongs unto you; we also will be with you; be of good Courage, and do it.}

28.5.E However, I will take the leave to say unto my Native Town, {O Town of many and mighty Salvations! God would bless thee as a Mountain of Holiness, and a Dwelling of Righteousness, if His Day might be duly observed in thee! Yea, do thou observe Gods Time, and thy time shall endure for ever.}
¶
28.8.E Fifthly and Finally; Let the Observation of the LORDS DAY, be mightily Enforced upon us, by our consideration of the {Consequences}.
¶
28.9.E And now Sirs, Both {Blessings} and {Curses}, are to be awfully set before you.
¶
28.10.E In the first place; Consider, I entreat you, I perswade you!

28.11.E Consider, the vast {Blessings} which the Observation of the LORDS DAY will bring upon you.

28.12.E {Blessed is the man who does this, and the Son of man, who lays hold on it.}

28.13.E Shall I Assert unto you, That the {Sabbath} is a {Seal} to the whole {Covenant of Grace}; a {Seal} common to both Testaments?

29.1.E It is an Assertion worth considering; and I will show you where you shall find it countenanced: Even in a, {Thus saith the Lord;} Isa. 56. 4.

29.2.E Where 'tis said of them that {keep the Sabbaths, They choose the things that please me, and they take Hold of my Covenant.}

29.3.E I am sure, That is a {Covenant} full of {Blessings}.

29.4.E O my Hearers, would you be put into a way to make sure of all the {Blessings} contained in the {Covenant of Grace}?

29.5.E Your Observation of the LORDS DAY, will bring you into the way. More particularly,
¶
29.6.E First, The Religious Observation of the LORDS-DAY, is an {Happy Token} of one bound for {Eternal Happiness}.

29.7.E It was said, {Ezek.} 20. 20. {Sanctify my Sabbaths, and they shall be a Sign between me and you, that ye may know, that I am the Lord your God}.

29.8.E Now the {Eternal Happiness} of the World to Come is intended in that Expression, {I am the Lord your God}.

29.9.E Behold, A {Sign} of that {Eternal Happiness} intended for us!

29.10.E Holy {Sabbath-keepers} have as I may say, {The mark of God on their foreheads.}

29.11.E God has made the {Sabbath}, a {Token} of that {Rest}, whereto He will one day bring His Children by the Lord Jesus Christ.

29.12.E He that conscionably keeps the {Day of the Lord}, hath a {Token} upon him, that he shall e're long enter into the {Joy of the Lord}.

29.13.E A {Well-kept Sabbath} is a little {Heaven upon Earth}; and a {Token} that we shall within a little while come to {Heaven}.

29.14.E Christian, Dost thou carefully Dedicate the {Lords-Day} unto an Intimate Conversation with the Lord, and with {Heaven}?

30.1.E Oh! 'Tis a {Token} from God upon thy Soul, that thou shalt e're long be with the Lord, {Beholding of His Glory}, and swallowed up with God, in the Entertainments of His Heavenly Kingdom.

¶

30.2.E Secondly; {Spiritual Blessings} do most observably flow from a Religious Observation of the {Sabbath}.

30.3.E We shall be {in the Spirit on the Lords-day}, if we keep the {Day}; and surrounded with all the {Blessings} of the {Spirit}.

30.4.E What is the {Sabbath day}, but the Souls {Market-Day?}

30.5.E It was promised, Isa. 59. 6, 7. {Every one that keepeth my Sabbath from polluting it, even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain, and make them Joyful in my House of Prayer}.

30.6.E If a man be very exact in keeping the {Lords-day}, you may take it for granted, that this man will grow {strong in the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ}.

30.7.E But if a man be very Remiss in keeping the {Lords-day}, you may even despair for the Interest of God, in the Soul of such a man, and write upon him, {He may have a Name to Live, but he is Dead}.

30.8.E And again; If a man will keep the {Lords-day} very exactly, he will be likely to have the {Love} of God marvellously visiting and refreshing, and irradiating of him.

30.9.E Whereas, many who complain, {The Comforter that should relieve my Soul, is far from me}; may do well to ask themselves, {Do not I keep the Lords-Day too Remisly}!

30.10.E To say all; Would we have our Souls fed with the {Manna} of Heaven?

30.11.E {In nostra Dominica Die, semper pluit Dominus Manna de Cælo.}

30.12.E 'Tis {Origens} Expression: On our {Lords-Day}, our Lord always Rains {Manna} from Heaven upon us.

31.1.E The {Ordinances} of God, These convey all {Spiritual Blessings} to the Souls, which do suitably approach unto them; they convey {Gracy}, they convey {Glory}, they convey every {Good Thing}.

31.2.E Yea, but by observing the {Lords-day} it is, that we are made capable of being reached by those {blessed Ordinances}. And,
¶
31.3.E Thirdly; {Temporal Blessings} too, do most observably follow on a Religious Observation of the {Sabbath}.

31.4.E {The Earth is the Lords}; On the {Lords-day}, abandon the {Earth}, and even from the {Earth} it self, will the Lord favour us with some Requital.

31.5.E It is Promised, Isa. 58. 13, 14. {Call the Sabbath a Delight, and I will cause thee to Ride upon the High-places of the Earth}; i.e. I'll bring thee into the Land of {Canaan}, a Land flowing with all the {Blessings} of the {Earth}.

31.6.E We cry out of {Poverty} rushing in upon us; permit me to offer an Expedient for the diverting of that {Poverty}; {The Lords-day well observed}, That, That would be found a rare Expedient.

31.7.E Our {Shops}, our {Ships}, our {Fields}, will all fare the better, for our Circumspection about the {Sabbath}.

31.8.E Yea, {Poor} men have sometimes grown {Rich}, to Admiration, by the {Blessing} of God, which has Rewarded their {Sabbath keeping}.

31.9.E The Mariners, that chuse to {set Sail} on the {Lords-Day}, and run {full Sail} into the Breach of the Holy Commandment, I don't think, they much befriend their Voyages; 

31.10.E yea, and it may be a Judgment of God upon them, if their Voyages do not fare the worse for it; it may be to harden them for the more of Judgment at the last.

31.11.E {This is the Day which the Lord hath made}, said they of old; & we will do as we ought to do upon it: Well, the next News upon it is, {O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity}.

32.1.E And, {O Lord, so dost thou use to deal with such as do thus love thy Name}; wondrous {Prosperity} uses to be their portion.

32.2.E Methinks, I hear the {Sabbath} pleading with us; 

32.3.E "Prove me now, if I do not bring a poure of Blessings upon you. Make a Trial, whether your Success be not most usually as your Sabbath is: make a Trial, whether by your seeking first the Kingdom of God, on the Sabbath of God, you don't find the more added unto you, in the rest of the week; make a Trial, whether the way to be blessed in your Basket and your Store, be not for you to resolve, that on the Sabbath you will not meddle with 'em."

32.4.E If the {Trial} were made, {And, Oh that it were made!}

32.5.E Certainly, the {Lords-day}, would grow into Request, even with the most {Earthly-minded} People among us.
¶
32.6.E {But if you will not hearken, and hallow the Sabbath-day}; Know it from the Lord, That horrible Prodigious, Tremendous {Curses} will come in the Room of these {Blessings}.

32.7.E Oh! Consider the {Curses} which the Violation of the {Lords-Day} brings upon the Guilty Violators.
¶
32.8.E Miserable {Sabbath-Breaker}; what is the horrid Language of thy {Sabbath-breaking}?

32.9.E Do but hear thy own Language, and be amazed.

32.10.E God graciously bestows all thy {Time} upon thee, only reserving a {Seventh part} of it, as an Homage unto Him, for all thy {Time}.

32.11.E Thy Language is, {I won't own my self beholden to God, for any of my Time!}

32.11.E O the infinite Patience of Heaven, (one might well say) that hot Thunderbolts from thence do not Stone the {Sabbath-breaker} to Death immediately!

33.1.E God allows thee precious opportunities for {Communion} with Himself on the {Lords-day}: Thy Language is, {Communion with God, is not worth any of my pains in looking after it}.

33.2.E God, on the {Lords-Day}, invites thee to a Figure and Foretast and Earnest of {Life Eternal}: Thy Language is, {I reject that Life Eternal, as not worth my looking after}.

33.3.E Methinks, I hear the Great God uttering His dreadful Thunder upon this thy horrid Language, and saying, 

33.4.E {Shall not I visit for these things, and shall not my Soul be Avenged on such a Sabbath-breaker}?
¶
33.4.E And let the faithful Warnings of Heaven set now before us, What {Vengeance}, and {Evil will pursue the Sinners}, who trample upon the Day of God.

33.5.E Awful was the Speech of old; Neh. 13. 18. {Ye bring firce wrath upon Israel, by Profaning the Sabbath.}

33.6.E So, even so, may the {Sabbath-breaker} be spoken to: 

33.7.E Profane man, Thou dost bring a {Fierce Wrath} from Heaven upon the; A {Wrath} upon thy Family a {Wrath} upon thy Neighbourhood; but above all, a {Wrath} upon thy own Soul.

33.7.E How should it be otherwise?

33.8.E The {Sabbath-Breaker} is in the High Road unto all manner of {Wickedness}: 

33.9.E How frequent is it, for Malefactors who Dy on the {Gallows} for their {Wickedness}, to go off Roaring, {Oh! Tis my Sabbath-breaking, Tis my Sabbath-breaking, that has brought me to all of this?}

33.9.E Ah, {Sabbath-Breaker}, Little dost thou imagine, what thou mayest come to!

33.10.E But if this be the High Road unto all manner of {Wickedness}, it must needs be so, unto all manner of {Destruction} too.

33.11.E O {Sabbath-breaker}, Why dost thou not say, {Destruction from God is a Terror to me!}

34.1.E The Judgments of God upon the Daring {Sabbath-breakers}, have been, how Terrible!

34.2.E How Terribly have such Wretches been smitten, how Terribly Damned, by the sudden Blows of the Almighty!

34.3.E {A strange punishment has been to those Workers of Iniquity}, who have thought much on the {Lords-Day} to rest from their Iniquity.

34.4.E {General Plagues} are not rarely inflicted, for this Impiety.

34.5.E We read of a pious King once in {France}, who observing that he met with many grievous Disasters in his Affairs, he reproved his Clergy for using so little pains to Reform the Manners of the people, and that he might prevent any more such Disasters, he procured it being ordained in a Council, {That the} LORDS-DAY {should be kept Religiously}.

34.6.E The want of this he thought, lay at the Bottom of all!

34.7.E The Reformed Churches abroad have commonly indulged themselves, in loose {Principles}, and loose {practices}, about the {Lords-Day}; as if the Necessity of keeping the {Lords-Day}, were, {Figmentum Anglicanum}; An English Fancy!

34.8.E But surely, tis no Fancy that {Christianity} runs at a low Ebb, in those Churches, and that horrendous Desolations are continually and successively harassing of them.

34.9.E Oh! That they would once at last Enquire, Whether their breaking of {Gods Rest}, be not a grand Reason why God with such plagues and storms, has been breaking of {Theirs.}

34.10.E The {English Nation} has better {Sababths} than any in the World, except another Nation on the same Island with it.

35.1.E But an open violence there once offered unto the {Sabbaths} of God, quickly issued in an {Horrible Tempest} on the Authors of it, and a {Wrath unto the uttermost}.

35.2.E I tremble when I read those words; Jer. 17.27. {If you will not Sanctify the Sabbath-Day, I will kindle a Fire that shall Devour, and shall not be quenched.}

35.3.E Ah, my dear {Boston}, Art thou not afraid of a {Devouring Fire}?

35.4.E Oh! That thy {Sabbaths} may carry the Symptoms of thy preservation!

35.5.E But be assured, That {personal plagues} also, will be the bitter and bloody Fruits of this Impiety. {Personal plagues}, yea, {Eternal} ones.

35.7.E We read of them that perish, Rev. 14. 11. {The Smoke of their Torments ascended up for ever and ever, and they have no Rest Day nor Night.}

35.8.E Oh, don't incur a {Torment without Rest}, by thy Antipathy to a {Sabbath of Rest}.

35.9.E There is {no Sabbath in Hell}; (as the fond Jews have dreamed) How properly does the Wretchedness belong to them, that would have {no Sabbath on Earth}!

35.10.E One hearing the {Sanctification of the Lords-Day} urged for, cryed out, {What, would you have a man be upon the Rack a whole Day together!}

35.11.E Man, if the {Lords-Day} put thee upon the {Rack}, I wonder how {Heaven} will agree with thee; {Heaven} which will be an {Everlasting Sabbath!}

35.12.E Such as now say of the {Sabbath}, {what a weariness is it?}

35.13.E certainly, I need not say, {Heaven} would be {weary} of them; I will rather say, they would be {weary} of {Heaven}, if it were possible for those {Defilers} to {Enter} into it!

35.14.E God has provided a {Rack} for such Criminals; but a {Rack}, on which they are to Ly, not for {a whole Day together}, but for ten Million Ages; for {Eternity, Eternity, Eternity!}

36.1.E Oh! {Consider this, ye that forget the} LORDS DAY, {lest he tear you in} Pieces, {and there be none to deliver you}.

¶

36.2.E I conclude, with the words of a famous {Parisian} Council; and all the Serious Christians in the Assembly, will I know, Agree in this Conclusion; 

36.3.E {It is fit for those that are Redeemed by the Grace of Christ, to abstain on that Day whereon the Author of Life Rose again, amd gave them Hope of a Resurrection, from the Worlds pleasures and their own; and be filled only with Spiritual Joyes, and busily Vacant with all their Hearts in the restless Praises of the Lord.}
