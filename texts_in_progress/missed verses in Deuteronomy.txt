E.9.1 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,

α.9.2 Missinninnuog matikken8og kah quogquonunkqussuog, wunneechan8oh Anakimsog, neg waheadcheg, kah papaume nag n8tamohpanneg, howan woh neepauit anaquabhettit wunnaumonuh Anak.
E.9.2 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak!

α.9.3 Newutche wohtam8k yeu kesukok, Jehovah kum-Manitt8m; noh negonáe qushkodteamukquean, onatuh machikkussuwae n8teau, nah pish uppaguanuh, kah nah pish wunn8kohkonuh anaquabeog, nemehkuh pish sohh8kau8og, kah teanuk paguanóog, neane Jehovah anukquean.
E.9.3 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.

α.9.4 Ahque n8wash ut kuttahut, mahche Jehovah kum-Manitt8m pogkenont wutch anaquabean, ahque n8wash, wutche nussampweusseonk waj Jehovah pethuunukque, ahtauunat yeu ohke, qut wutch ummatcheet8wongan8 yeush wutohtimoneash, Jehovah kum-Manitt8m, nah wussohh8kauoh wutch anaquabean.
E.9.4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.

α.9.5 Matta wutch kussampweusseonk, asuh kussampwetahaonk kuppetutteam ohtauunat wutohke, qut wutch ummatcheseongan8 yeush wutohtimoneash, Jehovah kum-Manitt8m wussohh8kauóoh wutch anaquabean, onk woh uppakodche ussen wuttinn8waonk ne chadchekeimomp k8sh8oh, Abraham, Isaak, kah Jakob.
E.9.5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

α.9.6 Newutche wohtash, Jehovah kum-Manitt8m, matta kittinnumunkk8un yeu wunohke ohtauunat, wutche kussampweusseonk, newutche kenaau chetauwussittippuk[a]nnu missinninnuog.
E.9.6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.

α.9.7 Mehquontash, ahque wunantash uttôh an m8m8sqheadt Jehovah kum-Manitt8m, musquantamunat ut touohkomuk, wutch na kesukok waj sohhaman ohkit Egypt, nô pajeh kuppeyonat yeu ayeuonk, kutayeuuhkonittue chekittauomw8 Jehovah.
E.9.7 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.

α.9.8 Wonk ut Horeb kumm8m8sqheomw8 JEhovah musquantamunat, nemehkuh Jehovah kummusquanumukou kuppaguanukqunnaóut.
E.9.8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.

α.9.9 Kohkukquean wadchut, nutattumunumunat hassune tableash, 8n8wae tableash, nish Jehovah ayimungqueógish, neit nutapip wadchuut yauunchage kesukquae, kah yauunchage nukkonae, matta nummeechum petukqunnunk asuh n8tattam nippe.
E.9.9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

α.9.10 Kah Jehovah nuttinnunnumunk neesinash qussukquanne tableash, wussukwhosuash nashpe wuttinnuhwhunitch God, kah naut wussukwhosu neane wame wuttinn8waongash, nish Jehovah anukqueógkupash wadchuut, wutch nôeu n8taut, ut mukkinneáe kesukodtut.
E.9.10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

α.9.11 Kah n$nih mahche mahtshunk yauunchage kesukodtash kah yauunchage nukonash, Jehovah nuttinnumunkup neesinash qussukquanne tableash, wunn8wae tableash.
E.9.11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.

α.9.12 Kah Jehovah nuttinuk, neepaush, teanuk 8msish yeu$wutch, newutche kummissinninnumog, neg sohh8wunadcheg wutch Egypt, nag anusheág, nag teanuk qushkeog wutch mayut, ne ann8nog, nag ayimóog sabassumwe nunneukontunk.
E.9.12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.

α.9.13 Nano Jehovah nukken8nuk, nuttinuk, yeug nauóog missinninnuog, kah kusseh chetauwussittuppukane missinninuog.
E.9.13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

α.9.14 Mukk8náeh onk woh nuppaguanóog, kah woh nutjsshkham 8wesuongan8 wutch agwe kesuk, kah kutayimaush wutohtimóin, anue menuhki kah missi onk nag.
E.9.14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.

α.9.15 Neit nukqushkem kah nunn8kem wutch wadchuut, kah wadchu chikohteau nashpe n8tau, kah neesinash wunn8wae Tableash, neese nunnutcheganit ohtaash.
E.9.15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.

α.9.16 Kah nunnatauwompip, kah kusseh, kummahche kummatcheneheomw8 Jéhovah kum-Manitt8mw8, kah kummahche ayimomw8 sabássumwe Calf: teanuk kukqushkemwop wutch mayut, ne Jehovah aun8nukquogkup.
E.9.16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

α.9.17 Kah nunnéemunum neesinash Tablsash kah nuppogketamunash wutch neeswe nunnutcheganit, kah nuss8quohkonash ut anaquabeog.
E.9.17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.

α.9.18 Kah nukkepshomp ut anaquabit Jehovah néane weske, yauúnchage kesukquae, kah yauunchagkodtash nukkonash, matta nummeech8 petukqunnunk, asuh n8tattam nippe, newutche wame kummatcheseóngan88ash, nish matcheseogish, matcheseog ut anaquabit Jehovah m8m8sqheonat.
E.9.18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

α.9.19 (Newutche n8wabesip musquantam8onk kah kussopitae matchenanittuonk, yeu nashpe Jehovah musquanumukqueog kuppaguanukqunaóont) qut Jehovah nunn8tunkup wonk na$ut.
E.9.19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.

α.9.20 Kah Jehovah muttae musquanumpop Aaronoh, wunnushonat: kah wonk nuppeantamw[a]nsheup Aaron na ahquompak.
E.9.20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

α.9.21 Kah nunnemunum kummatcheseonk, ne Calfe neh kesheogkup, kah nutchikoswop n8taut, nussukukauop, kah nukkushkuttahwhop, nó pajeh wuttinsukquesiñeat puppissiyeuut & nuppogketamup uppuppissiyeum, en sepuesut ne 8msishunk wutch wadchuut.
E.9.21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.

α.9.22 Kah ut Tabarah, kah ut Massah, kah ut Kibroth$Hattaavah, kumm8m8sqheomw8 Jehovah, musquantamunat.
E.9.22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.

α.9.23 Neane, Jehovah ann8nukqueog wutch Kadesh$Barnea, nowop, kuhkuhquek kah ahtóok ohke ne anumauunog, neit ayeuuhkonittue kutcheketamumwop wuttinn8waonk Jehovah kum-Manitt8mw8, kah matta k8namptau8op, asuh kuhkeihketam8mwop 8wadtauatonkqussuonk.
E.9.23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

α.9.24 Kutayeuuhkonittue cheketauomw8 Jehovah wutch na kesukok wahenog.
E.9.24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.

α.9.25 Yeu nuttinne kepshonah ut anaquabit Jehovah, yauunchadte kesukquieu kah yauunchage nukkonaeu, kah nukkepshomp newutche Jehovah n8wop, kuppaguanunumw8.
E.9.25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you.

α.9.26 Newutché nunnanompassumomp Jehóvah, kah nussip, woi Jehovah Manit, ahque paguas kummissinninnumog, kah kutahtóonk neg pohquohwhun[a]cheg nashpe kummissugken8onk, neg sohh8wunacheg wutch Egypt, nashpé mishe menutcheg.
E.9.26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

α.9.27 Mehquanum kittinninneumog Abraham Isaak kah Jakob, ahque monunneash wutcheketam8ongan8 yeug missinnuog asuh ummatcheseongan8, asuh uppanneseongan8.
E.9.27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:

α.9.28 Ishkont ohke nô waj sohh8wusseog, n8waog, newutche Jehovah n8nunum pas8onat ohkit nâ quoshomomp, kah newutche wussekeneauoh, wussohh8wunuh, nushonat ut touohkomuk.
E.9.28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.

α.9.29 Qut ohch nag kummissinninneumog kah kutahtóonk, neg sohh8wunatcheg nashpe mohsag kummenuhkesuonk, kah nashpe kussummagunum8e muhpit,
E.9.29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.

α.10.1 NA ahquompak Jehovah nuttugkup wunnagetahhash neesinash qussukquane tablesash, agqueneunkquakish nash weske, kah kuhkuhquehtah en wadchuut, kah ayish mehtugque Ark.
E.10.1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.

α.10.2 Kah pish n8sukkuhhum ut tablesut, kutt8ongash nish ohtagkupash ut weske tablesut, nish pohquonteaopash, kah pish nish kupponamunash Arkut.
E.10.2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.

α.10.3 Kah nutayimup shittimuhtugque Ark, kah n8[n]tahhamup neesinash qussukquane tablesash, neaneongquodtash nash weske, kah nukkúhkukquem en wadchuut, neesinash tablesash ohtaash ut nunnutcheganit.
E.10.3 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.

α.10.4 Kah wussukhum ut tablesut, neaunag negonne wasukuhwhosikup, piukquttash wuttinn8waongash, nish Jehovah anukqueógkupash ut wadchuut, wutch nôeu n8taut, ut moeáe kesukodtut, kah Jehovah nash nuttinumunkqunash.
E.10.4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.

α.10.5 Kah nukqushkem kah n8womussin wadchuut, kah nupponumup tablesash Arkut, ne kestauup kah nish ne ohteau, nean ann8sit Jehovah.
E.10.5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.

α.10.6 Kah wunnaumonuh Israel pomushaog wutch Beeroth ne wadtaumáag wunnaumonuh Jaakan, en Mosera: na Aaron wuttit nuppun, kah na$ut posekinon, kah Eleazer wunnaumon usseu sephausue aninnohsu onk nompe nagum.
E.10.6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.

α.10.7 Na wutch pomushoneau en Gudgodah, kah wutch Gudgodah, en Jotbath, sepue kah nippée ohke.
E.10.7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

α.10.8 
E.10.8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

α.10.9 
E.10.9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him.

α.10.10 
E.10.10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

α.10.11 
E.10.11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

α.10.12 
E.10.12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

α.10.13 
E.10.13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good?

α.10.14 
E.10.14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

α.10.15 
E.10.15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.

α.10.16 
E.10.16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.

α.10.17 
E.10.17 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:

α.10.18 
E.10.18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

α.10.19 
E.10.19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

α.10.20 
E.10.20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

α.10.21 
E.10.21 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

α.10.22 
E.10.22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.

α.11.1 
E.11.1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway.

α.11.2 
E.11.2 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,

α.11.3 
E.11.3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

α.11.4 
E.11.4 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day;

α.11.5 
E.11.5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place;

α.11.6 
E.11.6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel:

α.11.7 
E.11.7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.

α.11.8 
E.11.8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it;

α.11.9 
E.11.9 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey.

α.11.10 
E.11.10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs:

α.11.11 
E.11.11 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

α.11.12 
E.11.12 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.

α.11.13 
E.11.13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

α.11.14 
E.11.14 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

α.11.15 
E.11.15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full.

α.11.16 
E.11.16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

α.11.17 
E.11.17 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.

α.11.18 
E.11.18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.

α.11.19 
E.11.19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

α.11.20 
E.11.20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates:

α.11.21 
E.11.21 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

α.11.22 
E.11.22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

α.11.23 
E.11.23 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves.

α.11.24 
E.11.24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be.

α.11.25 
E.11.25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.

α.11.26 
E.11.26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

α.11.27 
E.11.27 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day:

α.11.28 
E.11.28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

α.11.29 
E.11.29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.

α.11.30 
E.11.30 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

α.11.31 
E.11.31 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein.

α.11.32 
E.11.32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day.

α.12.1 
E.12.1 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

α.12.2 
E.12.2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

α.12.3 
E.12.3 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place.

α.12.4 
E.12.4 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

α.12.5 
E.12.5 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:

α.12.6 
E.12.6 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks:

α.12.7 
E.12.7 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

α.12.8 
E.12.8 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

α.12.9 
E.12.9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you.

α.12.10 
E.12.10 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety;

α.12.11 
E.12.11 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

α.12.12 
E.12.12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

α.12.13 
E.12.13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest:

α.12.14 
E.12.14 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee.

α.12.15 
E.12.15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.

α.12.16 
E.12.16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.

α.12.17 
E.12.17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

α.12.18 
E.12.18 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

α.12.19 
E.12.19 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth.

α.12.20 
E.12.20 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

α.12.21 
E.12.21 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

α.12.22 
E.12.22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

α.12.23 
E.12.23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

α.12.24 
E.12.24 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.

α.12.25

So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

α.13.6 
E.13.6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;
